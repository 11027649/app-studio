# Creating a README

Add a `README.md` to the root of your repository to contain your proposal document. It should be formatted in [Markdown], hence the file extension. The proposal should at least include:

[Markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

* your project's title;
* a sentence summarizing your project;
* a bulleted list of features;
* hand-drawn sketches of the complete user experience;
* a bulleted list of any internal frameworks, libraries, or other technologies.

Note: features are [not the same as requirements](http://pmblog.accompa.com/2009/07/13/features-vs-requirements-requirements-management-basics/). Thus, do not simply repeat the list of requirements.

## Introduction

The project title, summary and feature list introduce the reader to the product. It should give a high-level overview of what can be done with the app.

## Sketches

The sketches should include the *complete* user experience of the product, so all interactions, paths and steps. Combine storyboarding techniques and annotations with precise sketches of each screen.

Sketches should accomodate the basic design rules of the platform that you will be working on. So, you will need to read up on these and make sure your sketches are in line with the intended ways of using e.g. pop-ups, color, undo, etc.

- [Designing for iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html)

To include the sketches in your proposal, upload the mockup images to a `doc`
directory in your repo. You should be able to include the images using the Markdown image tag.

## Frameworks

The list of frameworks is a first start at creating a technical design document, which you will be creating next week. For now, you should think of any functionality that you need the platform to provide, such as reading images.
