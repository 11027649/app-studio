# Design document

This milestone consists of delivering a technical design for your app. It
should convey the way your app fits into the platform you are building on, and
the specific design choices you make.

> Don't get involved in partial problems, but always take flight to where there is a free view over the whole single great problem, even if this view is still not a clear one. --- Wittgenstein, journal entry (1 November 1914)

The design document should somehow capture any and all design decisions that
you make before (or while) implementing your app. Reasonable to incude in your
design doc might be:

* Consolidated sketches of each "screen" in the application, along with the name of the controller that will manage each screen (each sketch should be a separate PNG).

    The idea is that there is one sketch for each controller of the app. This time, interactions are not relevant, but more so the specific controls that are needed on each screen, including tabs, menus, etc..

* An overview of model classes, private data for each class, and *public* methods (and their return types and/or arguments) that you've decided to implement. See [this page](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/classDiagram.htm) for a head start!

* A list of any APIs and frameworks that have not yet been named in the above, along with a description of what these will be used for. What kind of APIs do you need in the model classes? Maybe for persistence?

Be sure to update your README if you have made some incompatible decisions in
your design document. During the course, you can update all documentation at any time.

Add the design doc to your project on GitHub in a directory named `doc`. Like
the README, the design doc should be written in Markdown, so check out the
[syntax] again if needed. Put images in the same directory and embed them in your document.
