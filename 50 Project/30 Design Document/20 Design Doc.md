Your second milestone consists of delivering a technical design for your app. It
should convey the way your app fits into the platform you are building on, and
the specific design choices you make. After finishing the design doc, you will review them with your tutor.

## Design document

The format of your design doc is up to you, but it should somehow capture any
and all design decisions that you make before (or while) implementing your app.
Reasonable to incude in your design doc might be:

* consolidated sketches of each "screen" in the application, along with the name of the controller that will manage each screen (each sketch should be a separate PNG)

* annotations on each sketch of the class name of each view that is a platform-specific control (so: no checkboxes, but definitely tabbars or menus)

* a list of model classes, public and private fields, and *public* methods (and their return types and/or arguments) that you've decided to implement

* a list of any APIs and frameworks that have not yet been named in the above, along with a description of what these will be used for

Be sure to update your README if you have made some incompatible decisions in
your design document. You are free to update all documentation at any time.

Add the design doc to your project on GitHub in a directory named `doc`. Like
the README, the design doc should be written in Markdown, so check out the
[syntax] again if needed. If you'd like to include images in your design doc,
put them in the same directory.
