# Creating a README

Add a `README.md` to the root of your repository to contain your proposal document. This will be used as your 'proposal' for the application. It should be formatted in [Markdown], hence the file extension. The proposal should at least include:

[Markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

* your project's title;
* a sentence summarizing your project;
* a bulleted list of features;
* hand-drawn sketches of the complete user experience;

Note: features are [not the same as requirements](http://pmblog.accompa.com/2009/07/13/features-vs-requirements-requirements-management-basics/). Thus, do not simply repeat the list of requirements.
