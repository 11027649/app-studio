# Homework

Answer the following questions about the app described above. Some of the questions require not so much an *essay* answer, but more of a schematic description. Think carefully about how you want to answer each question accurately, thoroughly but concisely.

Are you having problems with the questions? Use a dictionary, discuss the
*meaning* of the questions with other students, or send an e-mail with any
question you might have. It is required that you provide your own answers,
however!

1. In paragraph 2.2, the *user experience* is defined as comprising of *interactions*, *paths* and *steps*. Hierarchically present the full UX of this week's app  on 1 page of paper, using short descriptions.

2. In paragraph 2.8, the *context* of apps is discussed. How is this week's app consistent with the norms prescribed by the *context*? Give 5 examples of where it is and isn't, and explain how it differs. Propose alternatives for the examples where it isn't (so you'd better have a couple of those, too).

3. Does this week's have *affordances*? Why, how, where, when? Can you improve on this app's affordances? To make your answer understandable, you probably have to explicitly state a definition of "affordance", or the parts that are relevant to your answer. Make sure you deeply understand the definition that you write down. If you have the feeling that you do not yet understand what an affordance is, do research to better understand it. Discuss with the teacher before submitting if needed.

   Hints:

   - Do not simply cite someone else's definition of affordance.
   - Do not just choose a definition. You must be able to defend your choice and wording!

4. List three *constraints* that you think the creators of the app have used to determine the app's shape. Illustrate with concrete examples from the app.

5. Make a table of all *concepts* in both chapters. The text contains quite a few concepts that can be used to discuss the quality of an app (e.g., *monotony* - we can discuss the monotony of some app). Include a short definition or few keywords that help you remember the definition of each concept. It does *not* have to be completely correct, though.

   Some of the concepts/attributes can take a lot of work when designing a really good app. Rate the concepts 1-10 on how much work it would be to account for that concept in creating an app.

   Hint: the book contains a lot of advice ("The product's setup process should exemplify its quality"). Those are not concepts.

   Hint: some paragraphs are not about application quality but about stuff around it. E.g., paragraph 1.10 is about marketing. We will not discuss these.

## Assessment

You work will be graded pass/fail on *clarity* and *thoroughness*.

- Use correct spelling and grammar. If that's not really your thing, best to get outside help in writing well!

- Think about the usability of your document: someone will have to read it, and it's your job to make that easy!

- The ultimate goal is to make sure you read well, understand how good apps are made and what you can do to improve. Show in your answers that you have learned.
