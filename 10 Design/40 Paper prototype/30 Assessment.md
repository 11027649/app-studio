## Assessment

The goal of prototyping is to understand if you (the designer) and the user understand each other. A subquestion that needs answering in this research-based designing is the following: is this indeed an useful application that solves a problem for a certain group of users. This question is not easily answered by performing tests. Questions you can answer however are: "Are there unexpected aspects of this application that make it less useful?"

The assessment is based on 7 topics: 5 topics that need to be described and two questions that need to be justified:

* The context of the application (model)
* Description of the scheme that you used to test (use cases, screens and structure)
* The measurements (videos)
* The results (findings)
* The conclusions (how to solve the findings)

Furthermore the following two questions must be answered:

* Why did you choose those specific use cases (what do they say about the use of the application as a whole)?
* To what extend do the results support your conclusions?


__Video__:

- 10 pt: complete registration of 2 tests
- 0 pt: <2 videos.

__Findings__:

- 10 pt: clear description of findings, linked to conceptual model and use case
- 5 pt: findings, but not clearly supported by experiment and theory
- 0 pt: no findings

__Solutions__:

- 10 pt: clear adaptation of conceptual model and/or use cases as a result of findings
- 0 pt: only textual description and/or not grounded in findings

__Justification for questions__:

- 20 pt: both questions have correct and clear answers
- 10 pt: one question has a correct and clear answer
- 0 pt: no answers
