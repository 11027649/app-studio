This assignment will complete the initial design that was started in class. You should finish your
flow model to cover all of the screens that you plan to implement as a part of your semester
project. Then you should create a paper prototype wireframe of all screens in detail. Each screen
should be on a separate paper and all text-input or other selections should be blank or their
default settings. You should create separate cutouts for any overlays/prompts.

You also must think of three to four main use cases of your application that you would like to test
in class next week. These should cover the common use cases of the application as well as anything
that you are having a hard time designing or where you think that users might have difficulties.

All screens and overlays should be brought to class next week for a usability trial that will be
conducted at the start of class. Each group will have team members from other groups try their
application by "using" the paper prototype for each of the identified use cases. One team member
will be responsible for acting as "the phone" changing the screens and overlays as the "user"
interacts with the paper.

The deliverable document should contain the following aspects:

- Models: a model that explains the concept of your application
- Use cases: what are the key path scenarios (primary actions and pathways through the system)?
- Structure and flows of your application.
- Screen design: wireframes. 
- Video material of your usability testing (of the most most important findings).
- Description of the most important findings.
- Description of how you have solved/are going to solve these issues.
