# Design practice: prototyping (group)

*Report due: next week (Monday).*

Last week and this week, you will work, as a group, on implementing a paper prototype and formally
evaluating it with a group of testers. Your most important task is to document this process.

The deliverable document should contain the following aspects:

- Overview structure of your application.
- Use cases: what are the key path scenarios (primary actions and pathways through the system)?
- Screen design: wireframes. 
- Video material of your usability testing (of the most most important findings).
- Description of the most important findings.
- Description of how you have solved/are going to solve these issues.

## Assessment

The goal of prototyping is to understand if you (the designer) and the user understand each other.
A question that needs answering in this research-based designing is the following: is this indeed
an useful application that solves a problem for a certain group of users. This question is not
easily answered by performing tests. Questions you can answer however are: "Are there unexpected
aspects of this application that make it less useful?"

The assessment is based on 6 items: four topics that need to be described and two questions that need
to be justified:

* Description of the scheme that you used to test (use cases, screens and structure)
* The measurements (videos)
* The results (findings)
* The conclusions (how to solve the findings)
* Why did you choose those specific use cases (what do they say about the use of the application as a whole)?
* To what extend do the results support your conclusions?

Therefore, the following aspects/sections must be present in your report:

Application overview:

- 10 pt: sketches of key screens in the application
- 0 pt: no high-level overview

Use cases:

- 10 pt: 2 unique use cases, choice of use case motivated by representativeness for whole app
- 5 pt: 1 unique use cases, choice of use case motivated by representativeness for whole app
- 0 pt: 0 unique use cases

Screen designs:

- 10 pt: detailed screens + interactions for each use case
- 5 pt: some details missing, too much magic in interaction (implicit)
- 0 pt: almost or no screens

Video:

- 10 pt: complete registration of 2 tests
- 0 pt: <2 videos.

Findings:

- 10 pt: clear description of findings, linked to use case
- 5 pt: findings, but not clearly supported by experiment and theory
- 0 pt: no findings

Solutions:

- 10 pt: clear adaptation of conceptual model and/or use cases as a result of findings
- 0 pt: only textual description and/or not grounded in findings

Justification for questions:

- 20 pt: both questions have correct and clear answers
- 10 pt: one question has a correct and clear answer
- 0 pt: no answers
