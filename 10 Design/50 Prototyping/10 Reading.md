# Weekly reading

Like last week, we'll read about interaction design:

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 3: *Simplicity & Clarity*
* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 4: *Managing Expectations*

The final two assignments rely on you having a grasp of what interaction design means, what it encompasses and what it means to design apps with the user experience in mind.
