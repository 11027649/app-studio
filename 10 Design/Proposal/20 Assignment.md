The goal of this assignment is to create a short 5-10 minute presentation that conveys the key ideas of your app concept derived from the field study data you gathered in the previous assignment.

Each group will have 5-10 minutes to present their project proposal. All
presentation materials must be in a Google Presentation. Be sure to set the
sharing preferences for your presentation to "Anyone with the link"

Focus on your domain area, the insights gained from your field study, and the
concept for the application motivated by how it derives from data from your
study.
