## This week's app: Facebook

This week's assignment concerns the *Facebook* app. If you do not have it, make
sure you get it.

## Reading

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 3: *Simplicity & Clarity*

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 4: *Managing Expectations*

## Homework

- Evaluate this week's app using a selection of relevant concepts in chapters three and four of Cadence & Slang.

Requirements:

- the goal of the evaluation is to describe and assess the app using these concepts

- use specific examples from the app to illustrate your assessment (you can use screen shots, too!)

- provide short definitions, in your own words (!), of the chosen concepts

- organize your document into a hierarchy that is meaningful to you (and the reader) -- not *just* the hierarchy of the source material

- do not focus on Nick D.'s advice ("don't do it this way") but on the underlying ideas of describing app quality

- make a coherent essay out of your observations

- as such, the document must show *your* understanding of the material

- aim for three to four pages of written text

## Assessment

This homework will be graded on *clarity* (how you organize the essay) and *thoroughness* (as evidence of your understanding).
