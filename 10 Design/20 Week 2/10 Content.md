## Homework

Are you having problems with the questions? Use a dictionary, discuss the
*meaning* of the questions with other students, or send an e-mail with any
question you might have. It is required that you provide your own answers,
however!

1. Develop a short personal mission statement for this course. What are your
personal goals?

2. Describe the complete experience of this week's app in terms of
*interactions*, *paths* and *steps* as defined by Nick D. Do this point-by-point, using short descriptions.

3. How is this week's app consistent with the norms prescribed by the *context*?
Give a couple of examples of where it is and isn't, and explain what the
context prescribes.

4. Does this week's have *affordances*? Why, how, where, when? Can you improve
on this app's affordances? To make your answer understandable, you probably
have to explicitly state your definition of "affordance", or the parts that are
relevant to your answer. Do not simply cite someone else's definition of affordance.

5. Make a list of important *concepts* in both chapters. A concept is an
important abstract thing that has a name. The text contains quite a few concepts
that are important for talking about interaction design. Include a short
definition or few keywords that help you remember the definition of each
concept. It does *not* have to be correct, though. Rate them 1-10 on how easy
it would be to use the concept in building an app.

Aim for ~100-150 words per answer.
