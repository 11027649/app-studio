## This week's app

This week, the assignment will concern any app you choose, as long it is on your phone and you can test it.

## Reading

Karl Ulrich, *Design: creation of artifacts in society*.

* chapter 1: *Introduction to Design*

* chapter 2: *Problem Solving and Design*

* chapter 3: *Design Problem Definition*

* chapter 4: *Exploration*

* chapter 7: *Aesthetics in Design*

## Homework

Choose an app you have on your phone -- preferably one that you really like or one that is really "meh" to you. Use the concepts from the readings to answer the following questions:

1. What gap in the user experience can you infer from the app's functionality? Create your own precise definition of this gap.

2. Do you think the designer really understands the problem? What are clues in the app's functionality to evidence presence or absence of understanding?

3. What stakeholder groups can you define for this app? In other words, does it serve different *kinds* of people? Which are these?

4. Give quite a few examples of needs that could be fulfilled for different stakeholders of this app. Have a look at competing apps to come up with needs that may not be fulfilled by the app you chose.

5. How often is this app updated? Have a look in the app store to find out. What evidence is there in the change logs that updates were made to correct for misunderstandings of user's needs?
