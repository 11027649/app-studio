# This week's app

The assignment below will concern any app you choose, as long it is on your phone and you can test it.

## Homework

Choose one app you have on your phone -- preferably one that you really like or one that is really "meh" to you. Use the concepts from the readings to answer the following questions:

1. What gap in the user experience can you infer from the app's functionality? Define this gap or problem very precisely. Is this problem uniquely solved by a mobile app? Or are there websites that provide a solution to the same problem? In other words, what is the added value of providing it as an app?

2. Do you think the designer really understands the problem? What are clues in the app's functionality to evidence presence or absence of understanding?

3. What market segments can you define for this app? In other words, does it serve different *kinds* of people? Which are these?

4. List examples of needs that could be fulfilled for different market segments served by this app. Have a look at competing apps to come up with needs that may not be fulfilled by the app you chose.

5. Prepare and submit one discussion question about the chapters above. We will discuss some of these in class.

Aim for ~100-150 words per answer.
