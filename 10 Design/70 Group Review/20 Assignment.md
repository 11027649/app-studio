# Homework

Evaluate this week's app using Nielsen's [Usability heuristics for user interface design](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/
). List about 10 problems with the user interface. You do not have to cover all heuristics.

## Format

Include:

- problem name
- heuristic
- description
- severity
- recommendation (if any)
- screenshot (probably)

Include a reference to Cadence where needed, e.g. if used in description or recommendation.

## Assessment

You work will be graded pass/fail on *clarity* and *thoroughness*.

- Use correct spelling and grammar. If that's not really your thing, best to get outside help in writing well!

- Think about the usability of your document: someone will have to read it, and it's your job to make that easy!

- The ultimate goal is to make sure you read well, understand how good apps are made and what you can do to improve. Show in your answers that you have learned.
