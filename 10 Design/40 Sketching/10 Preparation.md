# Weekly reading (individually)

In the next few weeks, we will be reading about the design of applications in Nick D.'s epic (but small) work on *interaction design*. The book contains a *lot* of information, so be sure to take your time to work through it and definitely make note of things that you do not completely understand!

> "Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful." - John Maeda

The final two assignments rely on you having a grasp of what interaction design means, what it encompasses and what it means to design apps with the user experience in mind.

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 1: *Empathy & Kindness*, deals with the question: who are you designing for?

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 2: *Consistency & Character*, deals with the question: how to make interacting with the product easy?

## Class questions

We will discuss the questions below in class, so think about the answers and make sure you are prepared. *Submit short versions of your answers as your assignment for this week.*

We will only check if you have actually done the work. The discussion next week may be used to obtain feedback on your answers.

1. In paragraph 2.8, the *context* of apps is discussed. An important property of context is that it is usually very different for different products. Give three examples of context that are highly relevant to mobile apps.

2. Give an example of an affordance that is typically present in a university classroom. Give two examples of *types* of affordances that can be found in mobile apps.

3. List three *constraints* that you think the creators of the app have used to determine the app's shape. Illustrate with concrete examples from the app.

4. The book contains a lot of advice. Some headings tell you to design in a particular way or pose constraints on how to proceed. Some of the advice is targeted at the design *process*. Other advice concerns the *product* that you are designing. Provide a list of 5 pieces of advice and include for each an argument as to why that advice particularly applies to app design.

5. The book also contains a lot of interesting terminology. There are many concepts that have a particular name in interaction design, and to reason about interaction design, it is important to know what many of these concepts mean. Give a list of 5 concepts with a definition *in your own words*.
