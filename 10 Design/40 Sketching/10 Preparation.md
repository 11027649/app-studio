# Weekly reading (individually)

In the next few weeks, we will be reading about the design of applications in Nick D.'s epic (but small) work on *interaction design*. The book contains a *lot* of information, so be sure to take your time to work through it and definitely make note of things that you do not completely understand!

> "Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful." - John Maeda

The final two assignments rely on you having a grasp of what interaction design means, what it encompasses and what it means to design apps with the user experience in mind.

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 1: *Empathy & Kindness*, deals with the question: who are you designing for?

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 2: *Consistency & Character*, deals with the question: how to make interacting with the product easy?

## Class questions

We will discuss the questions below in class, so think about the answers and make sure you are prepared.

1. In paragraph 2.2, the *user experience* is defined as comprising of *interactions*, *paths* and *steps*. Hierarchically present the full UX of this week's app  on 1 page of paper, using short descriptions.

2. In paragraph 2.8, the *context* of apps is discussed. How is this week's app consistent with the norms prescribed by the *context*? Give 5 examples of where it is and isn't, and explain how it differs. Propose alternatives for the examples where it isn't (so you'd better have a couple of those, too).

3. Does this week's have *affordances*? Why, how, where, when? Can you improve on this app's affordances? To make your answer understandable, you probably have to explicitly state a definition of "affordance", or the parts that are relevant to your answer. Make sure you deeply understand the definition that you write down. If you have the feeling that you do not yet understand what an affordance is, do research to better understand it. Discuss with the teacher before submitting if needed.

   Hints:

   - Do not simply cite someone else's definition of affordance.
   - Do not just choose a definition. You must be able to defend your choice and wording!

4. List three *constraints* that you think the creators of the app have used to determine the app's shape. Illustrate with concrete examples from the app.

5. Make a table of all *concepts* in both chapters. The text contains quite a few concepts that can be used to discuss the quality of an app (e.g., *monotony* - we can discuss the monotony of some app). Include a short definition or few keywords that help you remember the definition of each concept. It does *not* have to be completely correct, though.

   Some of the concepts/attributes can take a lot of work when designing a really good app. Rate the concepts 1-10 on how much work it would be to account for that concept in creating an app.

   Hint: the book contains a lot of advice ("The product's setup process should exemplify its quality"). Those are not concepts.

   Hint: some paragraphs are not about application quality but about stuff around it. E.g., paragraph 1.10 is about marketing. We will not discuss these.
