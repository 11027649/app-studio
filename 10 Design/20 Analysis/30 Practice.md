# Design practice: inductive analysis

In class, you've done an affinity analysis. Now, take some time to tidy it all up and make photos to document your work. Then, brainstorm concrete ideas for which you can find evidence in the data that these are viable!

## Assessment

1. The affinity is organized in a 3-level hierarchy:

    - Yes (10)
    - Hierarchy but not 3 levels (5)
    - No (0)

2. Second level notes are written in the first person as summaries of what is below them:

    - All (10)
    - Most (5)
    - Few/None (0)

3. Third level notes are third-person and succinctly summarize main point of data below:

    - All (10)
    - Most (5)
    - Few/None (0)

4. Multiple design ideas are identified and explicitly connected to areas of the affinity:

    - At least 5 ideas (10)
    - 2-4 ideas (5)
    - 0-1 ideas (0)
