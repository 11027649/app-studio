# Users and Apps

We'll be reading about the design of applications in Nick D.'s epic (but small) work on *interaction design*. The book contains a *lot* of information, so be sure to take your time to work through it and definitely make note of things that you do not completely understand!

(You can infer a lot of information about the interactions in this app from the
video. But to fully answer the questions, buy the app or come and try it at the
lab's iPad.)
