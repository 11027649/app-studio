# Homework

Answer the following questions about the *Rise* app describe above. Some of the questions require not so much an *essay* answer, but more of a schematic description. Think carefully about how you want to answer each question accurately, thoroughly and in a simple fashion.

Are you having problems with the questions? Use a dictionary, discuss the
*meaning* of the questions with other students, or send an e-mail with any
question you might have. It is required that you provide your own answers,
however!

1. Describe the complete experience of this week's app in terms of
*interactions*, *paths* and *steps* as defined by Nick D. Present this hierarchically, using short descriptions.

2. How is this week's app consistent with the norms prescribed by the
*context*? Give 5 examples of where it is and isn't, and explain how it differs.

3. Does this week's have *affordances*? Why, how, where, when? Can you improve
on this app's affordances? To make your answer understandable, you probably
have to explicitly state a definition of "affordance", or the parts that are
relevant to your answer. If you have the feeling that you do not yet understand what an affordance is, do research to better understand it. Discuss with the teacher.

	Hints:

	- Do not simply cite someone else's definition of affordance.
	- Do not just choose a definition. You must be able to defend your choice and wording!

4. List some constraints (5) that you think the creators of the app have used
to determine the app's shape.

4. What exactly is a *concept*?

5. Make a list of 10 very important *concepts* in both chapters.
The text contains quite a few concepts that are important for talking about
interaction design. Include a short definition or few keywords that help you
remember the definition of each concept. It does *not* have to be completely
correct, though. Rate them 1-10 on how easy it would be to use the concept in
building an app.
