# Design practice: prototyping (group)

*Wireframes due: next week in class. Report due: in two weeks.*

> Maximum group size is 4!

In your user research, you have found ideas for apps that could be made that could be interesting
to a certain group of people. In the coming weeks, you will sketch out the interactions for one of
those apps and create a paper prototype to test functionality. Your most important task is to
document this process.

First, complete the initial design idea that was started in class. You should finish your
high-level flow model to cover all of the screens that are in the app. Then you should create a
paper prototype wireframe of all screens in detail. Each screen should be on a separate paper and
all text-input or other selections should be blank or their default settings. You should create
separate cutouts for any overlays/prompts.

You also must think of three to four main use cases of your application that you would like to test
in class next week. These should cover the common use cases of the application as well as anything
that you are having a hard time designing or where you think that users might have difficulties.

All screens and overlays should be brought to class next week for a usability trial that will be
conducted at the start of class. Each group will have team members from other groups try their
application by "using" the paper prototype for each of the identified use cases. One team member
will be responsible for acting as "the phone" changing the screens and overlays as the "user"
interacts with the paper.

The deliverable document should eventually contain the following aspects:

- Structure and flows of your application.
- Screen design: wireframes. 
- Use cases: what are the key path scenarios (primary actions and pathways through the system)?

It should also contain the following, but don't worry about these until next week!

- Video material of your usability testing (of the most most important findings).
- Description of the most important findings.
- Description of how you have solved/are going to solve these issues.
