# Design practice: affinity analysis and proposal #

The proposal for your new app contains two parts: the written proposal and the oral
presentation in class.

## Written Proposal

Imagine you need to convince your stakeholders of investing time and money into the production of your app, and write this document as a proposal for developing your application. What is the scope of your app? What purpose does it serve? What design decisions did you make and more importantly: based on what did you make them? What does the timeline of the development of this app look like?

__Length__
: 10 pages (including figures). Although a single student may be serving as editor and
content gatherer, all students in the groups are required to author sections of the proposal
related to their chief area of responsibility. You must add an appendix containing the page counts
contributed by each team member.

__Title page__
: name of project, names of team members, group email address, type of report (proposal),
and current date.

__Abstract__
: one paragraph, ca. 150 words; state the problem, methods, expected results; no figures or
references in abstract; do not use first person pronouns.

__Table of contents__
: With a list of figures, if you have four or more. Figures should be numbered and labeled.

__Introduction__
: background motivation for the project. This section establishes the need for the
project; state primary and secondary audience.

__Motivation__
: the motivation for your project based on qualitative research study, description of
study and analysis, purpose of the service/app; its scope.

__Description of project__
: what are the key use cases for your application/service, design strategies
you will employ, technical requirements, tools needed and how you will acquire them, any
platform/browser dependencies.

__App design__
: give an impression of what your app will look like. Think of screenshots, wireframes, screenflows, etc. Accompany this with guiding and explaining text (just some images aren't enough).

__Tasks and milestones__
: show a Gantt chart which divides the life of the project into definable
tasks (vertical axis) over time in weeks (horizontal axis). You should decide on how long you think the development proces (with all its aspects) would take, which you will then devide into tasks and milestones. 

[This link] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process) is a good guideline for getting familiar with software development processes. There are several major development activities (planning, implementation, testing, documenting, deployment and maintenace), and several major development models. Please take a look at the Wikipedia page.

__References__
: must contain ACM DL references of related work). Scientific literature can support for example design decisions, or the motivation of your project.

__Please Note__
: All figures are given a caption and a figure number (placed below the figure) and are
referenced in the text (“See Figure 1”). Figures should be placed within the text as close as
possible to the reference.

## Oral Presentation

Each group will have 5-10 minutes to present their project proposal. All presentation materials must
be in a Google Presentation and linked from this Google Doc. Be sure to set the sharing preferences for your presentation to “Anyone with the link”

Focus on your domain area, the insights gained from your field study, and the concept for the
application motivated by how it derives from data from your study.
