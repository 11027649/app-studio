This assignment is meant to mirror a poster session at a major conference, such as CHI or Ubicomp
where researchers share their latest progress on work that is still ongoing. You will be asked to
prepare a poster for this session to share with classmates, course staff, and invited guests.

Prepare an A0-sized poster describing your project. Your poster should include information about
the motivation from your initial field study as well as some details about how the system works and
the key use cases.

Prepare the poster so that itâ€™s easy to understand what problems your application solves at a
glance and clearly provide subheadings so that viewers can focus on the areas that they are most
interested in. Include a small section on future plans including plans for your field study.
