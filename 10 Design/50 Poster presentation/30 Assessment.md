## Assessment

The goal of this poster is to give the reader insight in several aspects of your application. Your poster should contain or satisfy the following aspects:

__Motivation/problem statement__:
Describe the motivation for your application. What problem does it solve? How did the application concept originate from your generative research?

* the problem being solved is clearly formulated (5pt)
* the link between final application concept and research is explicit (+10pt)
* the problem statement is visually linked to the proposed solution (+10pt)

__Details about how the system works__:
Provide insight in how your system works. Show several screens and describe functionalities. From the poster it should be clear what the screenflow is.

* the basic functionality is described using screen mockups (5pt)
* the workflow is explicit (+10pt)

__Key use cases__:
Describe/visualize the key use cases of your application.

* the relevant use cases are described (15pt)

__Future plans__:
Provide a section on future work (things that might need further research, additional functionalities, etc.).

* the future work is present and linked to data, not only dreams (15pt)

__Graphicaly designed screens__:
The screens you visualize in your poster should be digitally designed (aka, no pencil-drawn images).

* screen designs are not hand-drawn and closely represent the screens in your prototype (15pt)

__Catching factor__:
The poster should have a factor that gets the reader's attention (colors, images, catch-prases, etc.).

* attention factor present and obvious (5pt)
* clear visual hierarchy that leads the reader (user) from the attention factor to interesting details (+10pt)
