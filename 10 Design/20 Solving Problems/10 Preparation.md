# Solving Problems

Last week, we explored what design is, and how problem solving and design relate. This week, we'll look at clearly defining design problems and exploring the solution space.

## Reading

Karl Ulrich, [*Design: creation of artifacts in society*](http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~ulrich/designbook.html).

* chapter 3: *Design Problem Definition*
* chapter 4: *Exploration*

## Assessment

The questions below will be the topic of our next class on Monday. Students will read and comment on each other's work. <strong>Bring a printed copy of your report!</strong> After class, the reports will be collected and graded: 0pt, 1pt (pass), 2pt (brilliant) per question. Good feedback by a peer can also be awarded 1pt.

## Questions

The questions below will concern any app you choose, as long it is on your phone and you can test it. Preferably, choose an app that you really like or one that is really "meh" to you. Provide a screen shot and a paragraph description of the application. Use the concepts from the readings to answer the following questions:

1. What market segments can you define for this app? In other words, does it serve different *kinds* of people? Give elaborate descriptions of at least three different segments.

2. List examples of needs that could be fulfilled for the three example segments served by this app. Have a look at competing apps to come up with needs that may not be fulfilled by the app you chose.

Now, imagine an app that aims to provide travellers with interesting places to visit around their current location.

3. Describe a grammar for such an app. Feel free to define a number of discrete options that make interesting differences in the potential design of the app.

	Use a visual/hierarchical representation in your answer so readers can quickly understand what you're thinking of. This might take a few tries to do in a nice way.

Aim for ~100-300 words per answer. Note: if the questions seem hard to answer for your chosen app, choose another one.
