## This week's app: Trello

This week's assignment concerns the Trello app. If you do not have it, make sure you get it.

<https://trello.com/platforms>

## Reading

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 5: *Perceived Accomplishment*

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 6: *Cognitive Cost*

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 7: *Cultural Norms*

## Homework

Are you having problems with the questions? Use a dictionary, discuss the
*meaning* of the questions with other students, or send an e-mail with any
question you might have. It is required that you provide your own answers,
however!

1. Evaluate the quiality of this week's app using relevant concepts in chapters five, six and seven of Cadence & Slang.

Requirements:

- the goal of the evaluation is to describe and assess the app using these concepts

- use specific examples from the app to illustrate your assessment (you can use screen shots, too!)

- provide short definitions, in your own words (!), of the chosen concepts

- organize your document into a hierarchy that is meaningful to you, and not *just* the hierarchy of the source material

- do not focus on Nick D.'s advice -- we're more interested if and where the app uses *modes* than in knowing that it violates the advice to avoid modes

- as such, the document must show *your* understanding of the material

- aim for ~four pages of written text

## Assessment

This homework will be graded on *clarity* (how well do you organize) and *thoroughness* (as evidence of your understanding).
