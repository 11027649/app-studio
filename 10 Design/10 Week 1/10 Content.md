## Homework

Check out question 5 first. It requires you to read all text. Are you having
problems with the questions? Use a dictionary, discuss the *meaning* of the
questions with other students, or send an e-mail with any question you might
have. It is required that you provide your own answers, however!

1. Develop a short personal mission statement for this course. What are your
personal goals?

2. Why do you think that the word *perceived* is used in Nick D.'s definition:

    > a <strong>task</strong> is a user's perceived goal

    Check out the dictionary definition for "perceived" if needed.

3. How is this week's app consistent with the norms prescribed by the *context*?
Give a couple of examples of where it is and isn't, and explain what the
context prescribes.

4. Does this week's have *affordances*? Why, how, where, when? Can you improve
on this app's affordances? To make your answer understandable, you probably
have to explicitly state your definition of "affordance", or the parts that are
relevant to your answer.

5. Make a list of important concepts in both chapters -- there are quite a lot!
Include a short definition or few keywords that help you remember the
definition. It does *not* have to be correct, though. Rate them 1-10 on how
easy it would be to use the concept in building an app.
