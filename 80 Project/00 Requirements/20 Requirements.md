# Project requirements

Here we list the requirements that all submitted projects should accommodate. *Functional requirements* define the scope of the projects, and *implementation details* make sure all projects can be graded in the same way, and ensure usefulness to a broad audience.

## Functional requirements

- The app should embody a solution for a clearly defined human problem and a clearly defined target audience. The solution should be reasonably original with regards to apps that are available on phones these days.

- You are invited to create an app concept of your own choosing, as long as it allows an app of sufficient complexity to be created that doesn't resemble the projects you did in earlier courses (pending approval by the course's instructor).

- The app must implement at the very least 3 separate screens/activities/controllers and be based on a combination of at least 2 online JSON APIs or 1 or 2 interesting libraries, any of which you have not used before. The staff must determine and agree to the complexity of the libraries/APIs and what you want to do with those.

- The product should not be dependent on a user entering lots of information or be an amalgam of several loosely coupled functions.

- The product embodies good interaction design practices.

## Implementation details

- Your app's source code should be managed in an *Android Studio 3* project or and *Xcode 9* project, and your app must use Java or Swift as the source code language.

- Your app should target a recent version of the Android or iPhone SDK and need not be backwards compatible.

- Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime. Staff is quite good at finding "crash opportunities".

- Your app must work within the simulator; you need not test it on actual hardware.

- You must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project (unless re-using a source file from another project).
