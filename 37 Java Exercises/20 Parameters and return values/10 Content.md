# Parameters and return values

This week we will take a more in depth look at methods, the functions of Java. When creating your apps you will often make use of methods, for example to handle your `onClick` events. These methods are often autogenerated, but sometimes you will find that it can be practical and efficient to create your own methods as well. Methods have parameters and return values, which determine which information is passed to a method and which information is returned, respectively.
