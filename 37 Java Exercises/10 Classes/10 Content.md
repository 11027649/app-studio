# Classes in Java

Java is programming language that makes use of objects and classes. You might be familiar with this idea, or it might be slightly new to you. For a very short introduction to the basics of Java, consult [this](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html) page.

## Installing Java

To run Java programs, you need to have Java installed. You might already have it on your own computer, but if not, use the following instructions to be able to use Java online:

- First, register for an account on [edx.org](https://edx.org), which will provide you with an account to log on to the CS50 IDE. If you already have an edX account, it's no problem to use that one.

- Now head to [cs50.io](https://cs50.io) and log on to the CS50 IDE. You may be prompted (again) for your email address. If so, after providing it, click **Private** under **Hosted workspace**, then click **Create workspace**.

- You should then be informed that CS50 IDE (aka Cloud9, the software that underlies CS50 IDE) is "creating your workspace" and "creating your container," which might take a moment. You should eventually see your workspace. If not, do just email your instructor to inquire!

## Exercises

- **How to get points:** Complete the exercises in [this PDF](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q2.pdf). Refer to the course's homepage for deadlines!  

- Download the Java files needed to complete the exercise [here](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/tsj4cp.html) (PersonTest.java).

## Tips

- To compile your java file to a `.class` file, use: `javac YourJavaFileName.java`

- You can run your program using: `java YourJavaFileName`

- If you have trouble getting your Java programs to run in the IDE, try:
	- `sudo apt-get update`
	- `sudo apt-get install default-jdk`
