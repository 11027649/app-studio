You will be using README-driven development in your projects. Read what
[Tom Preston-Werner] wrote about it. Some ideas of what to include in your
README might be:

* your project's title;
* a sentence summarizing your project;
* a bulleted list of features;
* a bulleted list of any frameworks, languages, libraries, or other technologies
  with which you'll implement your project;
* mockups and/or wireframes of the screens a user might encounter, and the way these are linked
  together.

[Tom Preston-Werner]: http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html

First, upload the mockup images to a `doc` directory in your repo. Then, write
your proposal in a file called README.md and put it in the root of your
repository. It should be formatted in [Markdown], hence the file extension.

Then follow these three simple steps to share your repository with us. You
should do this once for each project.

1. go to `https://github.com/<github username>/<repository>/settings/collaboration`
2. add the github users `stgm` and `Roxot`.
3. Send the link to your repository to your TA when you make an appointment to discuss it.

And don't forget to make an appointment to discuss your proposal.
