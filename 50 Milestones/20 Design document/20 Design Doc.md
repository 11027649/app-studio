Your second milestone consist of delivering a technical design for your app. It
should convey the way your app fits into the platform you are building on, and
the specific design choices you make. After finishing the design doc and style
guide, you will review them with your tutor.

## Design document

The format of your design doc is up to you, but it should somehow capture any
and all design decisions that you make before (or while) implementing your app.
Reasonable to incude in your design doc might be:

* a list of classes and public methods (and their return types and/or arguments) that you've decided to implement;
* more advanced sketches of UIs that clearly explain which features are connected to which underlying classes;
* a list of APIs and frameworks that you will be using to provide functionality in your app;
* a list of database tables and fields (and their types) that you've decided to
  implement (if needed).

Be sure to update your README if you have made some incompatible decisions in
your design document. You are free to update all documentation at any time.

Add the design doc to your project on GitHub in a directory named `doc`. Like
the README, the design doc should be written in Markdown, so check out the
[syntax] again if needed. If you'd like to include images in your design doc,
put them in the same directory.

## Style guide

The format of your style guide is up to you, but it should somehow capture the
style conventions to which you will adhere for this app's code. 

You do not need to write a complete style guide, because there will be existing
style guides for the platform that you are using.

First, review a few style guides to get a sense of their content:

* [CS50 style guide]
* [Google JavaScript style guide]
* [Ruby community style guide]
* [New York Times Objective-C style guide]

[New York Times Objective-C style guide]: https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide
[Ruby community style guide]: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
[CS50 Style Guide]: https://manual.cs50.net/Style_Guide
[Google JavaScript Style Guide]: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml

Then, find appropriate style guides for the languages and platforms of your choice, and write a document containing links to those guide and any peculiarities you would like to add. Among other criteria, we will judge your code by conformance to the style guides you have chosen.

Add the style guide to your project on GitHub in a directory named `doc`. Like
the README, the design doc should be written in Markdown, so check out the
[syntax] again if needed. If you'd like to include images in your style guide,
put them in the same directory.
