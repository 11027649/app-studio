Your second milestone consist of delivering a technical design for your app.
It should convey the way your app fits into the platform your building it on,
and the specific design choices you make. After finishing the design doc and
style guide, you should review them with your instructor.

## Design document

The format of your design doc is up to you, but it should somehow capture any
and all design decisions that you make before (or while)
implementing your app. Reasonable to incude in your design doc might be:

* a list of database tables and fields (and their types) that you've decided to
  implement;
* a list of classes and methods (and their return types and/or arguments) that
  you've decided to implement;
* more advanced sketches of UIs.

Be sure to update your README if you have made some incompatible decisions.
You are free to update your documents at any time.

Add the design doc to your project on GitHub in a directory named `doc`. Like
the README, the design doc should be written in Markdown, so check out the
[syntax] again if needed. If you'd like to include images in your design doc,
put them in the same directory.

## Style guide

The format of your style guide is up to you, but it should somehow capture the
style conventions to which you will adhere for this app's:

* CSS declarations
* HTML tags
* JavaScript code
* Rails code
* iOS code
* Java code
* SQL queries, if any

Before writing your own, review a few style guides to get a sense of their
content:

* [Google JavaScript style guide]
* [Ruby community style guide]
* [New York Times Objective-C style guide]
* [Coding guidelines for Cocoa]
