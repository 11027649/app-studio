## Help.

Help is available throughout the week at http://help.cs76.net/! We’ll do our best to respond within 24 hours. Be sure, though, to take advantage of lectures and sections as well as videos thereof!

Building Mobile Applications CSCI E-76 Harvard Extension School Spring 2012
All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course’s expectations must be your own unless collaboration is explicitly allowed by some project. Viewing, requesting, or copying another individual’s work or lifting material from a book, magazine, website, or other source—even in part—and presenting it as your own constitutes academic dishonesty, as does showing or giving your work, even in part, to another student.

Similarly is dual submission academic dishonesty: you may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another. Nor may you provide or make available your or other students’ solutions to projects to individuals who take or may take this course (or CSCI S-76) in the future.

You are welcome to discuss the course’s material with others in order to better understand it. You may even discuss problem sets with classmates, but you may not share code. You may also turn to the Web for instruction beyond the course’s lectures and sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problems on projects. However, failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you do discover outside of the course’s lectures and sections (even while respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be considered academic dishonesty.

If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion or action, contact the staff. All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly.

## Grades.

Your work on this project will be evaluated along four primary axes.

*Correctness.* To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

*Design.* To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

*Scope.* To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

*Style.* To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

## Student's choice.

Your task, by the project’s deadline, is to implement the project whose proposal was approved by your TF! In addition to the features you have required of yourself, we do have some additional specifications.

## Requirements.

*   By now, you should’ve heard back from your TF either approving your project or requesting changes to the proposal. You should not proceed with your project’s implementation until it has been approved. If it’s not yet approved, do feel free to drop your TF a note to inquire its status. Reasonable changes to your app are allowed with approval from your TF.

*   Along with your project, you will need to provide some documentation so we know how your project works and what it should do. Once your project is complete, write a document called README.pdf or README.txt that describes your app’s usage, its purpose, and any setup that’s required to get it working properly. In essence, reading through this documentation should provide us with enough information so that we understand your app and the entirety of its usage without needing to ask you any questions.

## Implementation Details.

*   Your app’s UI should be sized for an iPhone or iPod touch (i.e., 320 × 480 points) or for an iPad (i.e., 768 × 1024 points).

*   Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime.

*   Your project’s Product Name may be anything. Your project’s Company Identifier should be edu.harvard.extension.

*   Your app must use Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).

*   Your app must tolerate low-memory warnings (as by reloading views when needed).

*   Your app must work within the iPhone 5.1 Simulator; you need not test it on actual hardware. However, if you or your partner owns an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch, and you'd like to install your app on it, see https://manual.cs50.net/iOS for instructions.

## How to Submit.

*   First, open up your project in Xcode, select Clean from Xcode’s Product menu, and then close them again.

*   Then create a ZIP file containing the project’s folder and name the ZIP ########.zip, where ####### is your 8-digit Harvard ID (HUID), the same credential that you use to log into help.cs76.net.

*   Then head to https://www.cs76.net/submit, click the login link at top-right, click the link to your TF’s dropboxes at top-left, click this project’s own folder, click Upload File, and upload your ZIP file as prompted; no need to give it a title. Be sure not to click the wrong project’s folder. You may re-submit in this same manner as many times as you’d like. Just take care to delete any prior submissions.

*   Be sure not to submit or re-submit after this project’s deadline.
