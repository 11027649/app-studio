## Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. Demo your application during office hours.

All students must ordinarily submit this and all other projects to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.


## What to do

Create an app that will help users look at a restaurant's menu and compose an order of items, as well as allow them to "submit" the order and receive an estimated waiting time for this order. Of course, they must be able to view the price of items, the total price of the order and be able to remove items from the order as well! All of this should be done using an elegant and simple user interface.

This week we will revisit the user interface and take a look at Android's *Fragments*. Fragments are a good way to contain functionality of your app so that the user can easily toggle between these functialities.
