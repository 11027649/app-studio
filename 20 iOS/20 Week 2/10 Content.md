## Preparations

All materials for the iOS part of this course are on iTunes U. Here's a link. Best is to subscribe to this online course in iTunes so it will automatically download new materials as they become available.

<https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099>

So, many of the references in these iOS assignments are to materials form that course, like this one:

* Before you do anything else, watch *Lecture 3* and *Lecture 4*.

* Then, read up on some more Swift concepts. See *Reading: Project 2*.

## Homework

One part of this class is starting to fully understand and develop valid requirements for your assignments. Make sure you read the requirements, understand them, ask questions if needed, and always re-check the requirements when you *think* you're finished!

* Read the requirements for this week's assignment. See *Programming: Project 2*. Do not do any extra credit assignment!

## Assessment

This first homework assignment will be graded *in class* next week. You will need to show the app working on a real device.

The code of your app must be on GitHub. A link to your repository must be submitted on the *Submit* tab of this page.

Your work on this assignment will be evaluated along two axes primarily:

* *Scope* -- to what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

* *Correctness* -- to what extent is your code free of bugs?
