# GitHub in Xcode 9

## Preparation: Create a GitHub account
Projects you'll make in this course need to be on GitHub.
If you don't have an account, you can create one [here](https://github.com/join).

## Preparation: While creating your project

Be sure to enable "Source Control" while creating your project

If you haven't done that you can enable Source control in your menubar.

Choose your account (or Add a GitHub account...), add a repository name, be sure your projects visibility is on public and click Create!

**Note:** A good repository name is for example `MarijnJansen-Unit1-Light`
