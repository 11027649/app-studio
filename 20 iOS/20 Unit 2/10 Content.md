## Project

Now you are ready to make your first app! At the end of the chapter, you'll find a Guided Project to make a very simple app in Xcode. You can, however, choose to make your own app:

TBA


**How to get points:** [submit](#submit) your project first, then show your TA that you have created a working app and show it's code on GitHub. Do mind the deadline for each week!

## Getting credit

Make sure that you complete the exercises and put your finished project on [Github](/ios-reference/github) *before* the deadline. In the next class session, show your exercises and the working app to one of the staff.

Completing the exercises can earn you 1 point per week. The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  


This week, we will look at the following quality aspects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
- level of separation between game code and user interface code
