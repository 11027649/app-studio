# iOS: Introduction

We will use the latest versions of Xcode and Swift to develop iOS apps. You will need a Macbook running at least macOS Sierra!

- If needed, please upgrade your MacBook to macOS Sierra or High Sierra ([download here](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?l=en&mt=12)). This upgrade may take up to 2 hours to complete!

- Download and install the latest version of [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/xcode/id497799835?l=en&mt=12) from the Mac App Store. This integrated development environment is totally free and includes the ability to run apps on your own phone or on a simulator on your Mac.

- In the weeks ahead, you will work through the book [*App Development with Swift*](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996), which you can get in the iBooks Store. iBooks should be available on your Mac or on your iPad---but if it isn't, simply download it from the App Store. Make sure you are using the latest version of the book (Swift 4 edition).

- [This video from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/413/) will introduce you to the basics of creating a project with Xcode, and more. You'll learn how to comfortably navigate your project and gain insights into working with workspaces, targets, and schemes.

## Playground-labs on GitHub

During the course you will be working on some Swift exercises. To submit the exercises you'll need to put them on GitHub.
We made this easy for you and already created a template-repository!

So, go to the [repository](https://github.com/TheRijn/AppStudio-Playgrounds) and click the '![fork-icon](repo-forked.svg) Fork'-button.
GitHub will now create a copy of the repository for you. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository, and from now on, work on the exercises from this directory.

**Note:** This repository only contains the playground labs. All the other labs can be downloaded [here](labs.zip).
