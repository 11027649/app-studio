# iOS: Introduction

We will use the latest versions of Xcode and Swift to develop iOS apps. You will need a MacBook running  macOS **High Sierra** (10.13.4 or higher) or **Mojave** (10.14 or higher).
To check this, click the Apple (ï£¿) menu in the corner of your screen, choose About This Mac. You'll see the macOS name, such as macOS Mojave, followed by its version number.

- If needed, please upgrade your Mac to macOS Mojave 10.14 ([download here](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828?l=en&mt=12)). This upgrade may take up to 2 hours to complete!

- Download and install version **10** of [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/xcode/id497799835) from the Mac App Store. This integrated development environment is totally free and includes the ability to run apps on your own iPhone or on a simulator on your Mac.

- In the weeks ahead, you will work through the book [*App Development with Swift*](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996), which you can get in the Apple Book Store. Books should be available on your Mac or on your iPad. Make sure you are using the latest version of the book (Swift 4 edition).

- [This video from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/413/) will introduce you to the basics of creating a project with Xcode, and more. You'll learn how to comfortably navigate your project and gain insights into working with workspaces, targets, and schemes.
