# Introducing Swift

Swift is quite a new language. It was introduced in June 2014 by Apple and positioned as *the* language for development on iOS. So, lets learn it!

- On the Apple Developer website, there is a great video highlighting the syntax and meaning of the Swift language. It covers all of the basic syntax and more! Watching the video, you will probably see elements borrowed from C, Javascript and Python. It's quite a recognizable language!

- To get started in our book, please also work through chapters 1--4 of  *Introducing iOS 8*. Especially do not forget to study chapter 4, which will help you get started on object-oriented programming in Swift!
