# Learn Swift

Swift is quite a new language. It was introduced in June 2014 by Apple and positioned as *the* language for development on iOS. Previously, all code for Mac and iOS apps was written in the much older language called *Objective C*. And now, there's this brand new language that is based on many of the more modern languages that have been created over the past decade. So, lets learn Swift!

- On the Apple Developer website, there is a [great video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?id=402) highlighting the syntax and meaning of the Swift language. It covers all of the basic syntax and more! Watching the video, you will probably see elements borrowed from C, Javascript and Python. It's quite a recognizable language!

- To get started in our book, please also work through chapters 1--4 of  *Introducing iOS 8*. Especially do not forget to study chapter 4, which will help you get started on object-oriented programming in Swift!

- While studying these materials, please take note of all the things that you do not really understand. For example, you probably don't know what *closures* are. But there's probably more!
