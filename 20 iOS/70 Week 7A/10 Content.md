# Week 7: Multi-user apps

Going one step beyond last week's assignment, we will now work with saving data in an online database. This allows us to create multi-user app concepts.


## Reference

You might need these before implementing your project!

- [Volley](/android-reference/volley)
- [Parsing JSON](/android-reference/parsing-json)


## What to do

Implement [Trivia](/projects/trivia).


## Hint

If you want to use an HTTP API (non HTTPS) your iOS app needs explicit permission to allow this type of connection. Instructions how to set this up can be found on page 902 in the iOS book at "Guided Project: Restaurant - part 3 - Project Setup".


## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating **good quality** apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. For this week, make sure you try, as much as possible, to create an app that excels in these respects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
- more advanced code quality such as the structure of your project, separation of concerns


## Grading

*Before* the deadline, complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit the link to your project's GitHub repository at [Unit 6](/submit/unit-6).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show your finished exercises **and** the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
