# Journal

## Objectives

- Practice with SQLite as a database
- Create nice and intuitive layouts
- Use the Floating Action Button


## Background

For this project, you will create an app that represents a journal. In this app, you should be able to view a list of your journal entries, and of course also add new ones. A journal entry should typically consist of at least a few fields, such as the date/timestamp of the entry, the entry contents and some addition, such as an emoji reprenting your mood at the time of the entry. 


## Getting started

1.  Create a new Android studio project called **Journal**, using these settings:
    - Choose API 24 (Nougat) unless your own phone has an older operating system
    - Start with an Empty Activity which is called `MainActivity`
    - Leave all other settings unchanged

2.  Create a new, empty repository on the Github website. Name your repository `Journal`.

3.  Now, add a git repository to the project on your computer. Go to Android Studio, and in the menu choose **VCS -> Enable Version Control Integration**. Choose **git** as the type and confirm. This will not change much, but sets us up for the next steps.

    Note: if you get a popup to ask whether you would like to add some file to the repository, answer "No" for now. If you answer "Yes", things may get complicated later on.

4.  Link the local repository to your Github project. Choose **VCS -> Git -> Remotes...**. Add a remote with name "origin".

5.  Android Studio has generated quite a few files for your project already. To add these, let's **commit** and **push** those files to Github. Press **Cmd-K** or **Ctrl-K** to show the Commit Changes screen. There, you should see a long list of "unversioned files". Make sure all checkboxes are selected, enter a commit message `Initial project` and then press the **commit** button. Turn off code analysis.

6.  Press **Cmd-Shift-K** or **Ctrl-Shift-K** to show the Push Commits dialog. Press the **Push** button to send everything to Github.

Your project files should now be visible on Github. If not, ask for help!
