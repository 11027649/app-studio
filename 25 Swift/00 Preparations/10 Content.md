# iOS Preparations

We will use the latest versions of Xcode and Swift to develop iOS apps. You will need a Macbook running at least macOS Sierra!

- If needed, please upgrade your Macbook to macOS Sierra or High Sierra ([download here](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?l=en&mt=12)). This upgrade may take up to 2 hours to complete!

- Download and install the latest version of [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/xcode/id497799835?l=en&mt=12) from the Mac App Store. This integrated development environment is totally free and includes the ability to run apps on your own phone or on a simulator on your Mac.

- In the weeks ahead, you will work through the book [*App Development with Swift*](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996), which you can get in the iBooks Store. iBooks should be available on your Mac or on your iPad---but if it isn't, simply download it from the App Store. Make sure you are using the latest version of the book (Swift 4 edition).

- [This video from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/413/) will introduce you to the basics of creating a project with Xcode, and more. You'll learn how to comfortably navigate your project and gain insights into working with workspaces, targets, and schemes.
