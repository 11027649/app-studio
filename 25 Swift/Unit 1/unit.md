# Getting started with app development

Get started using Swift, a brand new language for developing apps on iOS. Get to know Playgrounds, a great place to explore using Swift! Also, build your very first app.

In some respects, Swift is a bit different from most programming languages. The lessons offer to learn everything from the ground up. Feel free to skip some of the parts about the programming language, but make sure that you know exactly how to write correct Swift code!

## 0. Getting the book
