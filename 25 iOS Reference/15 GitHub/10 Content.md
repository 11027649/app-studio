# GitHub in Xcode 10


### Preparation: Create a GitHub account

Projects you'll make in this course need to be on GitHub.
If you don't have an account, you can create one [here](https://github.com/join).

### Preparation: While creating your project

Be sure to enable "Source Control" while creating your project
