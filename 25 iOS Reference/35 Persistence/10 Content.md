# Persistence

This week we will learn how to save data in order to provide a more complete user experience. We will use the standard `UserDefaults` feature of iOS. This class allows you to persist (store) small pieces of data.

## Tutorials to get you started

Your might be getting used to the fact that a lot of documentation on the web is either for older versions of Swift, or even targeted at Objective-C. Here are two up-to-date blog posts:

- Persisting data with [UserDefaults](http://www.thomashanning.com/userdefaults/)

- Saving Swift [arrays](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25179668/how-to-save-and-read-array-of-array-in-nsuserdefaults-in-swift) in `UserDefaults`.

And of course, there is the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/userdefaults) that may help you find the right methods to call.
