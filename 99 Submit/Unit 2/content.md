## How to submit

1. Add a `README.md` with screenshot and a brief description. Use Markdown to format your README, as supported by GitHub. The screenshot must be uploaded to your GitHub repository first! Do that nice and clean in a separate folder called `doc`.

2. Commit and push your code.

3. Check if your project actually works for other developers! Go to the GitHub webpage for your repository and use the "Download zip" button. Unpack that zip somewhere unusual (your Desktop maybe?) and try to open and run the project.

4. When all is set, paste the GitHub repo URL in the textbox, below!
