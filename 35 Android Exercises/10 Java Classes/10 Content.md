# Java Classes

Java is programming language that makes use of objects and classes. You might be familiar with this, or this might be new to you. In this exercise we tackle the basics of classes in Java. 
Read this PDF and complete the questions. To run the Java programs you will create during the exercises, you can use the Cloud9 or CS50 IDE.

The needed Java files needed to complete the exercise can be found [here](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/tsj4cp.html) as well. 


## Tips
To compile your java file to a .class file, use:
`javac YourJavaFileName.java`

And then you can run it using:
`java YourJavaFileName`

If you have trouble getting your Java programs to run in the IDE, try:
`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install default-jdk`
