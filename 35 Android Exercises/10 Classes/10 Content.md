# Classes in Java

Java is programming language that makes use of objects and classes. You might be familiar with this idea, or it might be slightly new to you. For a very short introduction to the basics of Java, consult [this](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html) page.

**How to get points:** Complete the exercises in [this PDF](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q2.pdf). Refer to the course's homepage for deadlines!  

Download the Java files needed to complete the exercise [here](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/tsj4cp.html) (PersonTest.java). To run the Java programs you will create during the exercises, you can use the Cloud9 or CS50 IDE or another IDE capable of compiling and running Java files. If you have no IDE available, create an online IDE as per the instructions under Getting Started in [this assignment](https://cs50x.mprog.nl/psets/c).

## Tips

- To compile your java file to a .class file, use: `javac YourJavaFileName.java`
- You can run your program using: `java YourJavaFileName`
- If you have trouble getting your Java programs to run in the IDE, try:
	- `sudo apt-get update`
	- `sudo apt-get install default-jdk`
