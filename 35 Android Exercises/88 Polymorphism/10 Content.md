# Polymorphism

For this exercise, first complete [Exercise 12](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q12.pdf) as well.

Then continue to the [exercise on polymorphism](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q13.pdf).

The needed Java files needed to complete the exercise can be found [here](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/tsj4cp.html) as well (ShapesTest.java). 

## Tips
To compile your java file to a .class file, use:
`javac YourJavaFileName.java`

And then you can run it using:
`java YourJavaFileName`

If you have trouble getting your Java programs to run in the IDE, try:

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install default-jdk`
