# Parameters and return values

This week we will take a more in depth look at methods, the functions of Java. When creating your apps you will often make use of methods, for example to handle your `onClick` events. These methods are often autogenerated, but sometimes you will find that it can be practical and efficient to create your own methods as well. Methods have parameters and return values, which determine which information is passed to a method and which information is returned, respectively. 

You can find the exercise PDF [here](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q3.pdf)

The needed Java files needed to complete the exercise can be found [here](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/tsj4cp.html) as well (CitizenTest.java). 

## Tips
To compile your java file to a .class file, use:
`javac YourJavaFileName.java`

And then you can run it using:
`java YourJavaFileName`

If you have trouble getting your Java programs to run in the IDE, try:

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install default-jdk`
