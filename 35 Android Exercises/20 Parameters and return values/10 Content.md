# Parameters and return values

This week we will take a more in depth look at methods, the functions of Java. When creating your apps, you will sometimes find that it can be practical to move code into methods.

You can find the exercise PDF [here](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q3.pdf)

The needed Java files needed to complete the exercise can be found [here](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/tsj4cp.html) as well (CitizenTest.java). 

## Tips
To compile your java file to a .class file, use:
`javac YourJavaFileName.java`

And then you can run it using:
`java YourJavaFileName`

If you have trouble getting your Java programs to run in the IDE, try:
`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install default-jdk`
