# Course policies

## Collaboration

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course's expectations must be
the work of you and your partner (if applicable). Collaboration with anyone
other than the partner with whom you begin the course is not permitted unless
one of the course's heads approves a change of partner in writing. Partners must
contribute equitably to each milestone: you may not implement most or all of
some project's milestone and submit it on behalf of your two-person team.

You may read and comment upon classmates' code toward fulfillment of projects'
code reviews but only for classmates whose code is assigned to you by the
course's staff for review. You may integrate ideas and techniques that you
glean from your reviews of classmates' code and from classmates' reviews of
your code into your own work, so long as you attribute those ideas and
techniques back to your classmates, as with comments in your own code. As for
classmates beyond your own partner and those with whom you're involved in
reviews, you may discuss projects, including designs, but you may not share
code. In other words, you may communicate with those classmates in English,
but you may not communicate in PHP, JavaScript, or Objective-C and such
languages. If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact
the course's heads.

## Quoting sources

You may turn to the Web for instruction beyond the course's lectures and
sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not
for outright solutions to problems on problem sets or your own final project.
However, failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique
that you do discover outside of the course's lectures and sections (even while
respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be
considered academic dishonesty.

## Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. If the course refers
some matter to the Examination Board, the course reserves the right to impose
local sanctions on top of that outcome for that student that may include, but
not be limited to, a failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.

In all cases we follow the directives regarding fraud and plagiarism of the
University of Amsterdam and of the examination board of the Computer Science
BSc programme. Find them here in [English] and [Dutch].
