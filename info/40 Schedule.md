This is a short overview of the course schedule.

## Wednesday design practice

Six weeks of design practice. A lot of this will happen during class, but there is some homework.

- Week 7: Short presentation of the revised proposal. Homework: submit presentation/diagrams.

## Weekly app practice

A milestone for every week. You are required to discuss your milestones with the teaching assistants on the Wednesday or Friday lab session.

- Week 2: A working Hello World app (and a short proposal if you're doing a custom project)

- Week 3: The design document for your application.
