# Grading

Participation and practice assignments, and design homework will all be part of
your final grade. Non-effort in any of these will lead to a failing grade for
the course, regardless of compensation. But if you do the work and interact
regularly with instructor and fellow students, you should be able to make it!

Grading specification:

- homework participation: 20%
- graded design evaluation: 20%
- programming project and report: 60%

A student must ordinarily meet all deadlines in order to be eligible for a
passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's
instructor. Final grades will be based on performance on the course's
projects and design assignments.

Homework participation is graded as a percentage of the passes obtained by
doing the design writing practice and app platform practice homeworks. The
design review and the final project reports are evaluated primarily along axes
of clarity and thoroughness. The project's beta and release are evaluated
primarily along axes of correctness, design, and style.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Each student's final grade is individually
determined after input from the teaching staff. Prior experience, remarkable
effort, and upward trending may be considered.

## Homework participation

These parts of the course will earn you points for homework participation:

- each of the five programming exercises for your platform
- each of the three design review exercises
- code reviews
- design reviews

## Design review

The design review will be graded on *clarity* (how you organize the essay and
formulate your thesis) and *thoroughness* (as evidence of your understanding).

## Project

The project will be graded on the axes of *scope*, *correctness*, *design* and
*style*. A more detailed feedback scheme will be used in class and to perform a
final evaluation of your work.
