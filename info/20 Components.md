## Components

### Programming projects

Projects will be graded on the axes of scope, correctness, design and style:

* Correctness --- have you tried doing everything?

	1. takes too much time to get it working (bugs!)
    2. a whole parts is missing, or has to be fixed to get it working
	3. it works without real bugs, but a small part is unfinished
	4. everything is there, but not always the correct result
	5. even with erroneous input the program still works

* Design --- how orderly is your code?

	1. lots of complex code
	2. too complicated, but you seem to know your stuff
	3. straightforward code, could be put a bit inefficiently
	4. makes good use of the possibilities in the language
	5. you've read up on design and applied it to your code

* Style --- how readable is your code?

	1. not easily readable overall
	2. you've read the style guide but haven't applied it consistently
	3. your code is readable and consistent, barring some minor problems
	4. the code is consistent, and only well-reasoned deviations from the guide
	5. you've clearly made your own choices but maintained perfect consistency
