# Grading

A student must ordinarily meet all deadlines in order to be eligible for a
passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's instructor.

All weekly programming assignments count toward the final grade. With each assignment, criteria for grading are specified.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Each student's final grade is individually determined
after input from the teaching staff. Prior experience, remarkable effort, and
upward trending may be considered.
