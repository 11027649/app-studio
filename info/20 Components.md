## Components

### Projects

Projects will be graded on the axes of scope, correctness, design and style:

* Scope

	Have you tried doing everything?

	1. incomplete, even though some parts may be present
	2. whole parts are missing
	3. a small part of the requirements is not implemented
	4. everything is there
	5. above and beyond (please confer with your TA)

* Correctness

	Does your program do what is expected by a user?

	1. takes too much time to get it working
	2. some problems when testing, buggy
	3. it works without real bugs, but not always the correct result
	4. correct results in all common cases of input
	5. even with erroneous input the program still works

* Design

	How orderly is your code?

	1. lots of complex code, or avoiding newly learned keywords
	2. too complicated, but you seem to know your stuff
	3. straightforward code, could be put a bit inefficiently
	4. makes good use of the possibilities in the language
	5. you've read up on design and applied it to your code

* Style

	How readable is your code?

	1. once or twice you did it right, but you should study the style guide
	2. you've read the style guide but haven't applied it consistently
	3. your code is readable and consistent, barring some minor problems
	4. the code is consistent, and only well-reasoned deviations from the guide
	5. you've clearly made your own choices but maintained perfect consistency
