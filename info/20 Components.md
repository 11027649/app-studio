# Grading

The design track and the technical track are integral parts of this course and
aim to get you acquainted with app programming habits in a very short time.
Non-effort in one of the components will normally lead to a failing grade for
the course, regardless of compensation. But if you do the work and interact
regularly with fellow students and the course's staff, you should be able to
make it!

| design assignments | 7 assignments | 5% each |
| technical assignments | ~5 assignments | ~13% each |

A student must ordinarily meet all deadlines in order to be eligible for a
passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's instructor.

With each assignment, criteria for grading are specified.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Each student's final grade is individually determined
after input from the teaching staff. Prior experience, remarkable effort, and
upward trending may be considered.
