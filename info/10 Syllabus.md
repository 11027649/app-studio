*Edition: Fall 2016 (still under construction)*

Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined
to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course
teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's
most popular platforms, and how to deploy them on Google Play and the App
Store. Students document their work through a series of written and oral
proposals, progress reports, and code. Students learn to write native apps for
Android using Studio and the Android SDK, to write native apps for iPhones,
iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK, and to write web apps for
both platforms.

## Prerequisites

You need to have finished Programming 1 and 2, or equivalent, as decided by the
course's instructor. You need to be comfortable with programming, plus have
some experience with memory management, runtime analysis, design patterns,
databases, and basic data structures and algorithms. You need to have a laptop
capable of running either Xcode or Android Studio.

## Expectations

* Students are expected to attend all seminars, read all provided materials and
  to submit all seven problem sets, as specified below.
  
* Students are expected to use discussions with the course's instructor and
  teaching assistants to improve the technical and functional designs of all
  projects.

* Students wanting to learn iOS programming are expected to have a Mac (running
  OS 10.11) as well as an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch.

* Students wanting to learn Android can use any platform that Android Studio
  runs on as well as an Android phone or tablet.

## Schedule

We'll learn about mobile software development by understand how mobile platforms are designed and what parts we should get to know and what parts we can ignore. This course requires you to do a lot of programming! Every student will need to get acquainted with the platform of their choice and create lots of small apps.

Topics by week, subject to change, are:

| week | topic                   |  
| ---: | ----------------------- |  
|    1 | linking views with code |  
|    2 | screen layouts          |  
|    3 | multiple controllers    |  
|    4 | lists and data          |  
|    5 | data persistence        |  
|    6 | object modeling         |  
|    7 | more object modeling    |  

All assignments are released on Mondays and are due by the next Friday at any time. All of these assignments have to be handed in individually, but you are expected to generously help other students during the course.

Each Monday at 15:00, we'll kick off the week with an introductory demo, showing you how to get started quickly. On Tuesdays and Fridays, lab hours will be available to you for getting help with your assignments.

## Grades

A student must ordinarily meet all deadlines in order to be eligible for a
passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's instructor.

The final assignment in weeks 6--7 will be assessed by a team of teachers, the result of which will be your final grade for the course. Other assignments will be checked for completion. With each assignment, criteria for assessment are specified.

Feedback can be obtained in class while checking off previous assignments on Tuesdays. You are encouraged to clearly ask for feedback that you need to improve your future work.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Each student's final grade is individually determined
after input from the teaching staff. Prior experience, remarkable effort, and
upward trending may be considered.

## Books

No books are required for this course, but the list below may help you choose something relevant. Also, take a look at the shelf in the lab!

- Marko Gargenta and Masumi Nakamura, [*Learning Android*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023456.do)

- Matt Neuburg, [*iOS 9 Programming Fundamentals with Swift*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044345.do)

- [*The Swift Programming Language*](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)

# Collaboration

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course's expectations must be
your own work. You may read and comment upon classmates' code toward
fulfillment of projects' code reviews but only for classmates whose code is
assigned to you by the course's staff for review. You may integrate ideas and
techniques that you glean from your reviews of classmates' code and from
classmates' reviews of your code into your own work, so long as you attribute
those ideas and techniques back to your classmates, as with comments in your
own code. You may discuss projects, including designs, but you may not share
*code*. In other words, you may communicate with those classmates in English,
but you may not communicate in Swift, Java, or Objective-C and such languages.
If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact the course's
heads.

## Quoting sources

You may turn to the web for instruction beyond the course's lectures and
sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not
for outright solutions to problems on homework or your project. However,
failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you
do discover outside of the course's lectures and sections (even while
respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be
considered academic dishonesty.

## Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. In all cases we follow
the directives regarding fraud and plagiarism of the University of Amsterdam
and of the examination board of the Computer Science BSc programme. Find them
here in [English] and [Dutch].
