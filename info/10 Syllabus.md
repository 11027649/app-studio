*Edition: September 2014 (this is a beta version!)*

Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's most popular platforms, and how to deploy them in Android Market and the App Store. Students learn to write native apps for Android using Eclipse and the Android SDK, to write native apps for iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK, and to write web apps for both platforms.

Students work in small collaborative design teams to propose, build, and
document a semester-long project focused on mobile applications for cell
phones. Additional assignments include creating several small mobile
applications such as context-aware mobile media capture and games. Students
document their work through a series of written and oral proposals, progress
reports, and final reports. This course explores mobile imaging and media
creation, GPS location, user-centered design, usability testing, and
prototyping.

## Prerequisites

Programming 1 and 2 or equivalent, as decided by the courses' instructors. You
will need to be comfortable in programming, plus have some experience with
memory management and runtime analysis. You will need to have a laptop capable
of running Xcode or Eclipse.

## Expectations

### For all students

* You are expected to watch all lectures and sections and to submit all
  required projects, as specified below.
  
* You are expected to participate in the online environment provided ([Slack](https://minprog.slack.com/)), to ask questions that will help you get on with your projects, and answer questions that will help others get on.

* Students wanting to learn iOS programming are encouraged to have a Mac
  (running OS 10.9) as well as an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch; students
  wanting to learn Android can use any platform that Eclipse runs on and should
  probably have access to an Android phone or tablet.

### For non-cs students	

* You, individually, are expected to be at the weekly workgroup sessions led by
  a teaching fellow. We will make sure we notice your progress and we will help
  you to keep going in the right direction.

* You are expected to present three times on the progress of your work,
  together with your teammates.

* You are expected to co-author a written proposal as well as a
  scientific-style poster with your teammates.

* You are expected to hand in two programming assignments invidiually, but with
  generous help of your teammates, if needed. You are expected to help your
  teammates with the programming assignments, if needed. Do mind the collaboration policies!

### For computer science students

* You are expected to hand in one programming assignment that gets you started with the platform of choice.

* You are expected to deliver four milestones for each of two projects. You
  are also expected to meet a TA to discuss each deliverable and
  improve on your work.

* You are expected to use the discussions with the TA to improve the technical and functional designs of your projects.

## Getting help

You can get help from the TA's during weekly sessions, and you are encouraged to ask questions on [Slack](https://minprog.slack.com/). Your fellow students are supposed to help you out there, and our TA's will also monitor the `appstudio` channel.

## Grades

Other than that, you will meet with a course assistant to discuss each
milestone, and that is where you'll get detailed feedback on the products you
deliver. Often, these sessions will result in some extra work.


A student must ordinarily meet all milestone deadlines in order to be eligible
for a passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's
lecturer.

Each project's proposal, design doc, style guide, and code reviews are
evaluated primarily along axes of clarity and thoroughness. Each project's
beta is evaluated primarily along axes of scope, design, and style. Each
project's release is evaluated primarily along axes of scope, correctness,
design, and style. Axes' weights may vary by project.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Scores on projects' milestones may be normalized
across graders at term's end. Each student's final grade is individually
determined after input from the teaching fellows. Prior experience, remarkable
effort, and upward trending may be considered.

Partners ordinarily receive the same grade at the end of the course, except in
cases where one partner's contributions to projects fall short of
expectations.

Your final grade will be based on your performance on the course ºs projects. Projects will be evaluated along the axes of scope, correctness, design, and style, with the axes generally weighted in that same order.

A student must ordinarily meet all deadlines in order to be eligible for a
passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's instructor.

Each oral or written deliverable in the course is evaluated primarily along
axes of clarity and thoroughness. Each programming assignment is evaluated
primarily along axes of scope, design, and style. Axes' weights may vary by
deliverable.
