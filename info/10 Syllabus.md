*Edition: Fall 2016 (still under construction)*

Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined
to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course
teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's
most popular platforms, and how to deploy them on Google Play and the App
Store. Students document their work through a series of written and oral
proposals, progress reports, and code. Students learn to write native apps for
Android using Studio and the Android SDK, to write native apps for iPhones,
iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK, and to write web apps for
both platforms.

## Prerequisites

You need to have finished Programming 1 and 2, or equivalent, as decided by the
course's instructor. You need to be comfortable with programming, plus have
some experience with memory management, runtime analysis, design patterns,
databases, and basic data structures and algorithms. You need to have a laptop
capable of running either Xcode or Android Studio.

## Expectations

* Students are expected to attend all seminars, read all provided materials and
  to submit all seven problem sets, as specified below.
  
* Students are expected to use discussions with the course's instructor and
  teaching assistants to improve the technical and functional designs of all
  projects.

* Students wanting to learn iOS programming are expected to have a Mac (running
  OS 10.11) as well as an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch.

* Students wanting to learn Android can use any platform that Android Studio
  runs on as well as an Android phone or tablet.

## Schedule

We'll learn about mobile software development by understand how mobile platforms are designed and what parts we should get to know and what parts we can ignore. This course requires you to do a lot of programming! Every student will need to get acquainted with the platform of their choice and create lots of small apps.

Topics by week, subject to change, are:

All assignments are released on Mondays and are due by the next Monday at 13:00. All of these assignments have to be handed in individually, but you are expected to generously help other students during the course.

Each Monday at 15:00, we'll kick off the week with an introductory demo, showing you how to get started quickly. On Tuesdays and Fridays, lab hours will be available to you for getting help with your assignments.
