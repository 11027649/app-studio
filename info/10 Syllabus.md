Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined
to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course
teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's
most popular platforms, and how to deploy them on Google Play and the App
Store. Students document their work through a series of written and oral
proposals, progress reports, and code. Students learn to write native apps for Android using Eclipse and the Android SDK, to write native apps for iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK, and to write web apps for both platforms.

## Prerequisites

Programming 1 and 2 or equivalent, as decided by the courses' instructors. You
will need to be comfortable in programming, plus have some experience with
memory management and runtime analysis. You will need to have a laptop capable
of running Xcode or Eclipse.

## Expectations

* Students wanting to learn iOS programming are encouraged to have a Mac
  (running OS 10.9) as well as an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch; students
  wanting to learn Android can use any platform that Eclipse runs on and should
  have access to an Android phone or tablet.

* Students are expected to attend all but one weekly workgroup sessions led by
  the course's instructor, where everyone will help each other to make sense of
  the course's requirements.

* Students are expected to watch all lectures, read all provided materials and
  to submit all required projects, as specified below.
  
* Students are expected to hand in one programming project invidiually, but
  with generous help of teammates, if needed. You are expected to help your
  teammates with the programming assignments, if needed. Do mind the
  collaboration policies!

* Students are expected to use discussions with the course's instructor to
  improve the technical and functional designs of all projects.

* Students of computer science and artificial intelligence are expected to
  define their own programming project that uses any two of phone sensors,
  external APIs or OS integration, as accepted by the course's instructor.

## Grades

This section is not final yet, but participation and practice assignments, and design homework will all be part of your final grade. Non-effort in any of these will lead to a failing grade for the course, regardless of compensation.

It will be something like this:

- homework participation: 20% (3x design writing, 2x app practice)
- graded design review: 30%
- programming project: 30%
- final project report: 20%

A student must ordinarily meet all deadlines in order to be eligible for a
passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's
instructor. Final grades will be based on performance on the course's
projects and design assignments.

Each project's proposal, design doc and style guide are evaluated primarily
along axes of clarity and thoroughness. Each project's beta is evaluated
primarily along axes of scope, design, and style. Each project's release is
evaluated primarily along axes of scope, correctness, design, and style. Axes'
weights may vary by project.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Scores on projects' milestones may be normalized
across graders at term's end. Each student's final grade is individually
determined after input from the teaching staff. Prior experience, remarkable
effort, and upward trending may be considered.
