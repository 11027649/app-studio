# Native App Studio

*Edition: Spring 2017*

Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined
to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course
teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's
most popular platforms, and optionally, how to deploy them on Google Play and
the App Store. Students practice using the platforms through a series of
programming assignments, and working towards a final project to show off
everything that has been learned. Students learn to write native apps for
Android using Studio and the Android SDK *or* to write native apps for iPhones,
iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK.

## Prerequisites

You need to have finished Programming 1 and 2, or equivalent as decided by the
course's instructor. You need to be comfortable with programming, plus have
some experience with memory management, runtime analysis, design patterns,
databases, and basic data structures and algorithms. You need to have a laptop
capable of running either Xcode or Android Studio.

## Expectations

* Students are expected to participate in all Monday seminars, read all provided
  materials, implement six projects and submit six written assignments, as specified below.

* Students are expected to kickstart the weekly assignments early, so as to make optimal use of lab and teacher time.
  
* Students are expected to use discussions with the course's instructors and
  assistants to improve the technical and functional designs of all
  projects.

## What to do

We'll learn about mobile software development by understanding how mobile platforms are designed and what parts we should get to know and what parts we can ignore. We will separately study the theory of design as applied to mobile software development.

Every week, you will create one mobile app, each one making use of the new concepts introduced that week. You'll also have written and oral design assignments. Topics by week are:

| assigned |    due |  due 2 | programming             | due |  design                      |  
| -------: | -----: | -----: | ----------------------- | ---: | --------------------------- |  
|        1 | 15 Feb | 24 Feb | linking views with code | 13 Feb | introduction                |  
|        2 | 24 Feb | 28 Feb | screen layouts          | 20 Feb | exploring problem solutions |  
|        3 | 28 Feb |  7 Mar | multiple controllers    | 27 Feb | ...                         |  
|        4 |  7 Mar | 14 Mar | lists and data          | 6 Mar | ...                         |  
|        5 | 14 Mar | 21 Mar | data persistence        | 13 Mar | ...                         |  
|        6 | 21 Mar | 28 Mar | object modeling         | 20 Mar | ...                         |  

All programming assignments are released on Wednesdays and are due by the next Wednesday---at any time. All of such assignments have to be handed in individually, but you are expected to generously help other students during the course.

All design assignments are released on Wednesdays and are due by the next Monday, before class. We will provide detailed feedback on each other's assignments in class, so be sure to bring a printed version. 

On Tuesdays (11-13 Android, 13-15 iOS) and Fridays (13-15 iOS/Android), lab hours will be available to you in order to get help with your assignments.

Attendance for the class on Monday is mandatory to get credit for the design assignment of that week.

## Grades

Final grades for the course comprise three major parts:

| part               | percentage | notes                                   |  
| ------------------ | ---------: | --------------------------------------- |  
| design writing     |        35% | out of 6 points, weekly assignments     |  
| projects           |        35% | out of 12 points, depending on deadline |  
| final project code |        30% | code quality grade 1-10                 |  

With each assignment, criteria for assessment are specified.

A student must ordinarily submit all work in order to be eligible for a
passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's instructor.

Feedback can be obtained in class while checking off previous assignments on Tuesdays. You are encouraged to clearly ask for feedback that you need to improve your future work.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Each student's final grade is individually determined
after input from the teaching staff. Prior experience, remarkable effort, and
upward trending may be considered.

No retakes are possible of any part of the course.

## Books

No books are required for this course, but the programming books below may be referenced from time to time to indicate useful sections.

- Marko Gargenta and Masumi Nakamura, [*Learning Android*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023456.do)

- Matt Neuburg, [*iOS 9 Programming Fundamentals with Swift*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044345.do)

- [*The Swift Programming Language*](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)

# Collaboration

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course's expectations must be
your own work. You may read and comment upon classmates' code toward
fulfillment of projects' code reviews but only for classmates whose code is
assigned to you by the course's staff for review. You may integrate ideas and
techniques that you glean from your reviews of classmates' code and from
classmates' reviews of your code into your own work, so long as you attribute
those ideas and techniques back to your classmates, as with comments in your
own code. You may discuss projects, including designs, but you may not share
*code*. In other words, you may communicate with those classmates in English,
but you may not communicate in Swift, Java, or Objective-C and such languages.
If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact the course's
heads.

## Quoting sources

You may turn to the web for instruction beyond the course's lectures and
sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not
for outright solutions to problems on homework or your project. However,
failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you
do discover outside of the course's lectures and sections (even while
respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be
considered academic dishonesty.

## Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. In all cases we follow
the directives regarding fraud and plagiarism of the University of Amsterdam
and of the examination board of the Computer Science BSc programme. Find them
here in [English] and [Dutch].
