# Native App Studio

## Syllabus, Fall 2017

Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined
to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course
teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's
most popular platforms, and optionally, how to deploy them on Google Play and
the App Store. Students practice using the platforms through a series of
programming assignments, and working towards a final project to show off
everything that has been learned. Students learn to write native apps for
Android using Studio and the Android SDK *or* to write native apps for iPhones,
iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK.

## 0. Getting Started 

- Check if your [personal timetable](https://datanose.nl/) shows App Studio
- Read the remainder of this syllabus
- Practice object-oriented concepts in Java or Swift
- Create your first app!
- If in doubt, contact the course's heads at <help@mprog.nl> or speak to an assistant

<a name="expectations"></a>

## 1. Expectations 

You are expected to complete all provided exercises, attend all programming labs, submit five fully working practice apps, as well as a final project.

<a name="prerequisites"></a>

## 2. Prerequisites 

Programming 1 and 2, or equivalent, as decided by the course's instructor. You need to be
comfortable with memory management, runtime analysis, design patterns, databases, and basic data
structures and algorithms. You also need to have a laptop capable of running either Xcode or Android
Studio.

<a name="staff"></a>

## 3. Staff & Asking Questions 

The course's staff consists of your instructor and many teaching assistants. You are encouraged to speak to any of the staff at the lab to get help with your problem sets or to ask questions about lectures. Send a help request by using the "Ask" menu, above. Due to the size of the course, we canâ€™t usually respond to email inquiries about your assignments. You are encouraged to speak to a student assistant or the instructor at the lab. Below you will find a list of the courses's instructors:

Martijn Stegeman

*instructor* <help@mprog.nl>

Renske Talsma

*teaching assistant (Android)*

Julia Anten

*teaching assistant (Android)*

Marijn Jansen

*teaching assistant (iOS)*

Emma Hokken

## 4. Grades & Deadlines 

Every week, a new exercise and new guided project will be made available. In the last two weeks, during the final project you will create an app of your own. 
The current exercise and guided project can be found in the "Current" menu atop the website. 

You must complete all guided projects and a final project to be eligible for a satisfactory grade, unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

Final grades are determined using the following weights:

| exercises       | 20% |
| guided projects | 60% |
| final project   | 20% |

No retakes are possible for any part of the course. You may re-take the course as a whole in a next semester.

<a name="exercises"></a>

### 4.1 Exercises 

To learn the specifics of iOS or Android, tutorials are offered. Earlier in the course, the exercises focus on learning a new programming language and reinforcing your knowledge of object-oriented design. Later, emphasis shifts to complex parts of the programming platform, allowing you to make more interesting applications. 

TODO You do not have to hand in your exercises, but you have to show to an assistant that you have completed them. This can also be done before the deadline, of course! 

| no |   deadline |  
| -: | ---------: |  
|  1 | Mon 30 Okt |  
|  2 | Mon  6 Nov |

|  4 | Mon 20 Nov |  
|  5 | Mon 27 Nov |  

<a name="projects"></a>

### 4.2 Guided projects 

Each week, you will create an app using the concepts from exercises and tutorials. Points can be earned by completing the guided projects and showing the fully functioning application during office hours. Keep in mind that in order to be eligible for points, you must have uploaded your project on GitHub and have completed the exercise of that week as well.

| no | 2 point deadline | 1 point deadline |  
| -: | ---------------: | ---------------: |

|  5 |      Fri   1 Dec |      Mon   4 Dec |  

Feedback can be obtained in class while checking off assignments. You are encouraged to clearly ask for feedback that you need to improve your future work, this also includes code quality!

<a name="final"></a>

### 4.3 Final project 

In the last few weeks of the course, you will implement a final project. You will receive a set of requirements for the app. However, much of the design is left up to you, giving you an opportunity to show the skills that you gained in earliers weeks. In particular, the final project will be assessed on such factors as user interface design and code quality. During these weeks, there are no exercises to be completed. 

**Deadline**: Friday, 15 December 23:59, or just a little bit later.

<a name="officehours"></a>

## 5. Office Hours 

Office hours are opportunities for help with projects and exercise materials alongside the course's teaching assistants. Office hours are scheduled in the offical time tables.

<a name="tutoring"></a>

## 6. Tutoring 

For students who avail themselves of the course's other resources but still find themselves struggling, the course offers tutoring, to the extent possible, providing opportunities for students to work with the course's staff one-on-one or in particularly small groups. To arrange, contact the course's heads.

<a name="books"></a>

## 7. Books 

### Android

No books are required for students of the Android platform, but the following book may provide additional learning material: Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart and Kristin Marsicano, [*Android Programming, the Big Nerd Ranch Guide*](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/)

### iOS

Students of the iOS platform need to aquire one book in particular:

- Apple, [*App Development with Swift*](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?l=en&mt=11) (Free)

The books below may provide additional learning material:

- Matt Neuburg, [*iOS 10 Programming Fundamentals with Swift*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920055211.do)

- Apple, [*The Swift Programming Language*](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)

<a name="collaboration"></a>

## 8. Collaboration

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course's expectations must be
your own work. You may read and comment upon classmates' code toward
fulfillment of projects' code reviews but only for classmates whose code is
assigned to you by the course's staff for review. You may integrate ideas and
techniques that you glean from your reviews of classmates' code and from
classmates' reviews of your code into your own work, so long as you attribute
those ideas and techniques back to your classmates, as with comments in your
own code. You may discuss projects, including designs, but you may not share
*code*. In other words, you may communicate with those classmates in English,
but you may not communicate in Swift, Java, or Objective-C and such languages.
If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact the course's
heads.

<a name="quoting"></a>

### 8.1 Quoting sources 

You may turn to the web for instruction beyond the course's lectures and
sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not
for outright solutions to problems on homework or your project. However,
failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you
do discover outside of the course's lectures and sections (even while
respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be
considered academic dishonesty.

<a name="regulations"></a>

### 8.2 Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. In all cases we follow the directives
regarding fraud and plagiarism of the University of Amsterdam and of the Computer Science BSc
programme. Find them here in [English] and [Dutch].
