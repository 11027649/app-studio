Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's most popular platforms, and how to deploy them in Android Market and the App Store. Students learn to write native apps for Android using Eclipse and the Android SDK, to write native apps for iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK, and to write web apps for both platforms.

Students work in small collaborative design teams to propose, build, and
document a semester-long project focused on mobile applications for cell
phones. Additional assignments include creating several small mobile
applications such as context-aware mobile media capture and games. Students
document their work through a series of written and oral proposals, progress
reports, and final reports. This course explores mobile imaging and media
creation, GPS location, user-centered design, usability testing, and
prototyping.

## Prerequisites

Programming 1 and 2 or equivalent, as decided by the courses' instructors. You
will need to be comfortable in programming, plus have some experience with
memory management and runtime analysis. You will need to have a laptop capable
of running Xcode or Eclipse.

## Expectations

* Students are expected to attend or watch all lectures and sections and to submit all projects.

* You are individually expected to be at the weekly workgroup sessions led by a teaching fellow. This will make sure we notice your progress and we can help you to keep going in the right direction.

* You are expected to present three times on the progress of your work, together with your teammates.

* You are expected to co-author a written proposal as well as a scientific-style poster with your teammates.

* You are expected to hand in three programming assignments invidiually, but with generous help of your teammates, if needed. You are expected to help your teammates with the programming assignments, if needed.

You are required to work in the lab for some amount of time during the week, as
agreed upon before starting the course. You are expected to deliver, with the
same partner (if applicable) for each, four milestones for each of four
projects. You are also expected to meet a course assistant to discuss each
deliverable and improve on your work.

Working in pairs is optional. Students are encouraged to enroll with a friend,
but this is not required. Students wanting to learn iOS programming are
encouraged to have a Mac (running Mountain Lion) as well as an iPad, iPhone, or
iPod touch; students wanting to learn Android can use any platform that Eclipse
runs on and should probably have access to an Android phone or tablet.


## Getting help

Your most important resource for help in learning the material in this course
is your fellow students. Work closely with your teammates. Also, regularly
confer with some of the other students. You are responsible for helping each
other learn.

## Grades


Other than that, you will meet with a course assistant to discuss each
milestone, and that is where you'll get detailed feedback on the products you
deliver. Often, these sessions will result in some extra work.


A student must ordinarily meet all milestone deadlines in order to be eligible
for a passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's
lecturer.

Each project's proposal, design doc, style guide, and code reviews are
evaluated primarily along axes of clarity and thoroughness. Each project's
beta is evaluated primarily along axes of scope, design, and style. Each
project's release is evaluated primarily along axes of scope, correctness,
design, and style. Axes' weights may vary by project.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Scores on projects' milestones may be normalized
across graders at term's end. Each student's final grade is individually
determined after input from the teaching fellows. Prior experience, remarkable
effort, and upward trending may be considered.

Partners ordinarily receive the same grade at the end of the course, except in
cases where one partner's contributions to projects fall short of
expectations.

Your final grade will be based on your performance on the course ºs projects. Projects will be evaluated along the axes of scope, correctness, design, and style, with the axes generally weighted in that same order.

A student must ordinarily meet all deadlines in order to be eligible for a
passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's instructor.

Each oral or written deliverable in the course is evaluated primarily along
axes of clarity and thoroughness. Each programming assignment is evaluated
primarily along axes of scope, design, and style. Axes' weights may vary by
deliverable.

Teammates ordinarily receive the same grade at the end of the course, except in

* Class participation	10%
* Mobile observation study	15%
