# Native App Studio

*Edition: September 2015, still under construction*

Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined
to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course
teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's
most popular platforms, and how to deploy them on Google Play and the App
Store. Students document their work through a series of written and oral
proposals, progress reports, and code. Students learn to write native apps for
Android using Studio and the Android SDK, to write native apps for iPhones,
iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK, and to write web apps for
both platforms.

## Prerequisites

Programming 1 and 2 or equivalent, as decided by the courses' instructors. You
will need to be comfortable in programming, plus have some experience with
memory management, runtime analysis, data structures and algorithms. You will
need to have a laptop capable of running Xcode or Android Studio.

## Expectations

* Students wanting to learn iOS programming are encouraged to have a Mac
  (running OS 10.9) as well as an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch; students wanting
  to learn Android can use any platform that Eclipse runs on and should have
  access to an Android phone or tablet.

* Students are expected to attend all but one weekly workgroup sessions led by
  the course's instructor, where everyone will help each other to make sense of
  the course's requirements.

* Students are expected to watch all lectures, read all provided materials and
  to submit all required projects, as specified below.
  
* Students are expected to hand in one programming project invidiually, but
  with generous help of teammates, if needed. You are expected to help your
  teammates with the programming assignments, if needed. Do mind the
  collaboration policies!

* Students are expected to use discussions with the course's instructor to
  improve the technical and functional designs of all projects.

* Students of Artificial Intelligence are expected to define their own
  programming project that uses any two of phone sensors, external APIs or OS
  integration, as accepted by the course's instructor.

## Schedule

We've got a fairly regular schedule:

- there are short lectures on Mondays, introducing you to important course materials
- all deadlines are on Tuesdays
- there are workgroups on Thursdays, where you get help with programming
- there are tutoring opportunities throughout the week, to help you out individually

These are the main activities during the course:
