## Assignment

So, this is the final week and your best chance to make something of your own! There is one important constraint, however: the application concept should be based on a public API with open data. It should also be a "live" API, where you can do requests from your app for more data; for example, using JSON.

Some suggestions for finding APIs:

- <https://opendatanederland.org>
- <https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets>
- <http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory>

Other than that, your app must be non-trivial. For example, there should be some browsing, searching or other interesting interaction.
