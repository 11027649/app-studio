# Your first app

This first week, you'll learn a new programming language (again!). Choose either *Java* for Android or *Swift* for iOS development. 

For *Swift*, download Xcode from the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

For *Android*, download Android Studio SDK [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). You will also need to install addional SDK packages before you can get started, which is explained [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html).
