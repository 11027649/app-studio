# Learn Git

All programming assignments in this course must be submitted through *Git*. Git is a system to manage (mostly) text files and keep track of the history of a project. Good then, that program code is (mostly) text files!

At the end of this week, your first assignments are due, so the first thing on your list should be to learn Git. There is a great online course available, that will teach you more than enough Git to use. Git is often used with multiple users, to share code, but this is not your current use case. Luckily, this will make things a bit simpler.

Please be aware that you must use GitHub to store your code *repositories*. So, first things first, create an account at <https://github.com/> and then get an educational upgrade at <https://github.com/edu>. This upgrade will give you five *private* repositories for free.

## Learn version control using Git

Finally, for this assignment, head to <http://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/videos> and try along with the video course.
