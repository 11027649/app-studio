## iOS

Complete the Swift object-orientation tutorial from [Ray Wenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/81952/intro-object-oriented-design-swift-part-1). Be sure to do the tutorial by coding along and trying everything from the text.

## Submit instructions

Do all exercises as required, and create a Git repository to store your answers. You should put this repository on GitHub, and then submit a link to the repository, below. This way, we'll have access to all your files and can review your progress.

## Assessment

This assignment counts towards the points you can earn for doing exercises! Your submission will only be scored in terms of *scope*: have you done everything that is required?
