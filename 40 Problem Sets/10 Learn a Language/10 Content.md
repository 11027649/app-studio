# Learn yourself a new language

This first week, you'll need to start learning the programming language that you will be working in for your app projects. Please refer to these pages for the resources that are needed:

- [Learn Java for Android](/android/learn-java)
- [Learn Swift for iOS](/ios/learn-swift)

## Submit instructions

Do all exercises as required, and create a Git repository to store your answers. You should put this repository on GitHub, and then submit a link to the repository, below. This way, we'll have access to all your files and can review your progress.
