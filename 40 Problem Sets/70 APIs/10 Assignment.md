# Build Your Own!

*Due: Sunday night, 22 May, 2016*

## Objectives

- Understand how to use APIs to get structured open data.
- Practice with doing HTTP requests in apps.
- Practice with making your own app from scratch.

## Preparation

- On iOS: Read about [API's](/ios/apis).

## Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope
: To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

Correctness
: To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design
: To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style
: To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

All students must ordinarily submit this and all other problem sets to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

## Assignment

So, this is the final week and your best chance to make something of your own! There is one important constraint, however: the application concept should be based on a public API with open data. It should also be a "live" API, where you can do requests from your app for more data; for example, using JSON.

Some suggestions for finding APIs:

- <http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory>

## Requirements

- Concur your app proposal with the TA's to ensure the scope is sufficient.

- Implement HTTP-requests in your application.

## Getting started

1. Create an empty [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) repository to manage your code.

2. Create a new project, using this pattern as a name: `studentname-pset5`.

## How to submit

1. Add a `README.md` with screenshot and a brief description. Use Markdown to format your README, as supported by GitHub. The screenshot must be uploaded to your GitHub repository first! Do that nice and clean in a separate folder called `doc`.

2. Commit and push one last time (hopefully!).

3. Check if your project actually works for other developers! Go to the GitHub webpage for your repository and use the "Download zip" button. Unpack that zip somewhere unusual (your Desktop maybe?) and try to open and run the project.

4. When all is set, paste the GitHub repo URL in the textbox, below!
