# Unit 1: Getting Started

In this unit, you'll be introduced to writing classes in Java, and of course, you are going to install Android Studio and create your first app! That app will not contain a lot of code, but it's still going to take you some time to get used to the Android Studio IDE!


## Java labs

Each unit contains exercises to help you master the Java language. It's a recap of basic object-oriented concepts like classes, instantiation etc. If you're already familiar, you should still use the lab to get acquainted to Java-specific syntax.

- Go to [Lab 1](https://lab.cs50.io/Vluuks/AndroidPractice/labified/Week1/Lab/).
- Login with your GitHub credentials, which will be used to save your lab between sessions.


## Android practice

Before making an app, you'll need some explanation about the parts of Android that you need to make it. In this unit, we focus on the basics of building a **user interface**, or in other words: the screens that the user sees and can touch and interact with.

Read and understand this:

- [Views](/android-reference/views)

Do this:

- [Practice with ConstraintLayout](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/constraint-layout/index.html)


## Project

Now you are ready to make your first app, [Mr. Potatohead](/guided/mr-potatohead)! The assignment takes you step-by-step through making it, while introducing elements of the Android Studio IDE and the architecture of Android source code. You will likely run in to practical problems, which you will need to solve before the deadline!

## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. In addition, we'd like you to work on **good quality apps**. For this week, you'll be graded on these aspects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends


## Grading

Make sure that you complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github *before* the deadline. Your project's code needs to be on GitHub before it may be signed off. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit your project's code at [Unit 1](/submit/unit-1).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show your finished exercises **and** the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
