# Unit 1: Getting Started

In this unit, you'll be introduced to writing classes in Java, and of course, you are going to install Android Studio and create your first app! That app will not contain a lot of code, but it's still going to take you some time to get used to the Android Studio IDE!

1.  To get started, check out how to create a new Android project:

2. Every unit contains exercises for the Java language. If you already know Java, some of the exercises will not take much time. But defininitely do them anyway!

    - Start with an [overview of Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxRRO9175A). Make notes!
    - Do the exercises on [Methods, properties and constructors](/java-exercises/classes)
    - Do the exercises on [Inheritance](/java-exercises/inheritance)

3. Before making an app, you'll find some explanation about the parts of Android that you need to make apps. In this unit, we focus on the basics of building a **user interface**, or in other words: the screens that the user sees and can touch and interact with.

    - [Views](/android/views)
    - [Layouts](/android/layouts)
    - [State](/android/state)

## Project

Now you are ready to make your first app! You can choose between two projects:

- **Guided project: [Mr. Potatohead](/guided/mr-potatohead)** takes you step-by-step through making your first app. You'll probably choose this one if you haven't built applications on a platform before.

- **Unguided project: [First App](/projects/first-app)** gives you a set of requirements with which you make your app. You'll probably choose this one if you have done more than a couple of programming courses. If you don't know how to start, talk to your teacher or switch to the guided project!

**How to get points:** show your TA that you have created a working app and show it's code on GitHub. Do mind the deadline for each week!
