# Unit 1: Getting Started

In this unit, you'll be introduced to writing classes in Java, and of course, you are going to install Android Studio and create your first app! That app will not contain a lot of code, but it's still going to take you some time to get used to the Android Studio IDE!

1. To get started, follow the instructions on these pages from the Android website:

    - [Create an Android project](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html)
    - [Run your app](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html)
    - [Build a simple user interface](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.html)

    Note: in the tutorial above, you got a sneak peek at the new programming language called Kotlin! However, this course uses Java for developing apps. From now on, when creating your projects, leave the "Kotlin" and "C++" options unchecked.

2. Every unit contains exercises for the Java language. If you already know Java, some of the exercises will not take much time. But defininitely do them anyway!

    - Start with an [overview of Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxRRO9175A)
    - [Methods, properties and constructors](/android-exercises/classes)
    - [Inheritance](/android-exercises/inheritance)

3. Before making an app, you'll find some explanation about the parts of Android that you need to make apps. In this unit, we focus on the basics of building a **user interface**, or in other words: the screens that the user sees and can touch and interact with.

    - [Views](/android/views)
    - [Layouts](/android/layouts)
    - [State](/android/state)

4. Now you are ready to make your first app, [Mr. Potatohead](/projects/mr-potatohead).
