# Unit 1: Getting Started

In this unit, you'll be introduced to writing classes in Java, and of course, you are going to install Android Studio and create your first app! That app will not contain a lot of code, but it's still going to take you some time to get used to the Android Studio IDE!

To get started, check out how to create a new Android project:

## Exercises

Each unit contains exercises to help you master the Java language. If you already know Java, some of the exercises will not take much time. But defininitely do them anyway!

- Start with an [overview of Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxRRO9175A). Make notes!
- Do the exercises on [Methods, properties and constructors](/java-exercises/classes)
- Do the exercises on [Parameters and return values](/java-exercises/parameters-and-return-values)
- Do the exercises on [References](/java-exercises/references)

## Android explanation

Before making an app, you'll find some explanation about the parts of Android that you need to make apps. In this unit, we focus on the basics of building a **user interface**, or in other words: the screens that the user sees and can touch and interact with.

- [Views](/android-reference/views)
- [Layouts](/android-reference/layouts)
- [State](/android-reference/state)

## Project

Now you are ready to make your first app! You can choose between two projects:

- **Guided project: [Mr. Potatohead](/guided/mr-potatohead)** takes you step-by-step through making your first app. You'll probably choose this one if you haven't built applications on a platform before.

- **Unguided project: [First App](/projects/first-app)** gives you a set of requirements with which you make your app. You'll probably choose this one if you have done more than a couple of programming courses. If you don't know how to start, talk to your teacher or switch to the guided project!

## Getting credit

Make sure that you complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github *before* the deadline. In the next class session, show your exercises and the working app to one of the staff.

Completing the exercises can earn you 1 point per week. The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  

This week, we will look at the following quality aspects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
