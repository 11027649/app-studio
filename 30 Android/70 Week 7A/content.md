# Unit 6: Firebase

In this unit, you'll learn about using Firebase, which is an online database from Google. It allows you to make apps that help people communicate, share information or simply chat.


## Java exercises

Nothing new!


## Android explanation

Before making an app, you'll find some explanation about the parts of Android. To download data from the web, we'll be using the Volley framework. You'll also learn about loading JSON data into your application and extracting interesting information from it.

- [Firebase](/android-reference/firebase) for making "online" apps

The following video may help you (now and in the future) to design your apps with people in mind. The presentation shows some essential ideas on making systems simple and easy to use.

## Project

There's only one project this week:

- **Semi-guided project: [Trivia](/guided/trivia)** takes you (partially) step-by-step through making an app.


## Getting credit

There are a couple of minimum requirements for submitting your project:

- all project code must be available on a GitHub repository
- in the root of the GitHub repository, there must be a README.md containing the app description, your name and a screenshot

Make sure that you complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github *before* the deadline. In the next class session, show your exercises and the working app to one of the staff.

Completing the exercises can earn you 1 point per week. The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  

We will look at the following quality aspects:

- easy to use, no odds and ends
- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency
- more advanced code quality such as the structure of your project, separation of concerns
