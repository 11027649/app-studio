This week you will learn about creating your own classes and how to use them. We will also cover Utility Classes and touch on the use of Singletons in the demonstration.

## Tutorials to get you started

To refresh your memory, [here](http://www.journaldev.com/9383/android-internal-storage-example-tutorial) is a short tutorial on how to save data to the internal memory of your phone (as you will implement in this week's app).

If you still feel a bit overwhelmed by OOP (*Object Oriented Programming*), read [this](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaIntroduction/article.html) guide on Java Programming. For this week's assignment you can skip to part 4: *Java language structure*, which explains how classes work. However, parts 6 and 7 also contain a lot of useful information.
