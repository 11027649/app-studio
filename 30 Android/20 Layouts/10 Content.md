# Layouts

This week we will cover how to lay out a GUI in Android, as well as much more about many GUI widgets and events that they can handle. We will also briefly touch on the Android action bar.

## Readings

* First, read chapters 5--7 from *Learning Android*.

## Tutorials to get you started

You might already have noticed that Android offers different layouts during the build of your first app. This week's demonstration shows the differences between the various layouts and how to use them. To refresh your memory, [this](http://o7planning.org/web/fe/default/en/document/1189465/android-ui-layouts-tutorial) tutorial covers all the layouts discussed (and more!) and offers you some sample code to experiment with. Do try to fully understand what you are using, don't just blindly copy the contents! 

In addition to layouts, the Android Action Bar (AKA *App Bar*) is an important part of the GUI. For a better understanding of the App Bar, follow the steps in [this](http://www.journaldev.com/9357/android-actionbar-example-tutorial) short tutorial.
