# Layouts



## Readings

* First, read chapters 5--7 from *Learning Android*.

* CS193a, [Lecture 2](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/02-layout-gui.pdf)

* Lecture [code](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/02-layout-gui.pdf), [MainActivity.java](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/02/MainActivity.java), [activity_main.xml](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/02/activity_main.xml).

Note: these videos are not even a year old, but already slightly out of date. If you can't find some part of Android Studio or something isn't working, please confer with your classmates or send an e-mail!

## Homework

One part of this class is starting to fully understand and develop valid requirements for your assignments. Make sure you read the requirements, understand them, ask questions if needed, and always re-check the requirements when you *think* you're finished!

* [Assignment with requirements](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/homework/hw2-spec.pdf) (do Mr. Potatohead!)

* [Mr. Potatohead files](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/homework/mr-potato-head-images.zip)

## Assessment

This first homework assignment will be graded *in class* next week. You will need to show the app working on a real device.

Your work on this assignment will be evaluated along two axes primarily:

* *Scope* -- to what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

* *Correctness* -- to what extent is your code free of bugs?
