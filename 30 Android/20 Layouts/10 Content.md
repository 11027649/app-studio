# Layouts

This week we will cover how to lay out a GUI (*Graphical User Interface*) in Android, as well as much more about many GUI widgets and events that they can handle. We will also briefly touch on the Android action bar.

## Readings

Read chapters 5--7 from *Learning Android*.

## Tutorials to get you started

You might already have noticed that Android offers different layouts during the build of your first app. To refresh your memory, this [Android Basic Layout](http://www.journaldev.com/9495/android-layout-linearlayout-relativelayout-example-tutorial) tutorial covers all basic types of layout and offers you some sample code to experiment with. Do try to fully understand what you are using, don't just blindly copy the contents!

In addition to layouts, the Android Action Bar (AKA *App Bar*) is an important part of the GUI. For a better understanding of the App Bar, follow the steps in this short [Action Bar](http://www.journaldev.com/9357/android-actionbar-example-tutorial) tutorial.
