# Layouts

This week we will cover how to lay out a GUI in Android, as well as much more about many GUI widgets and events that they can handle. We will also briefly touch on the Android action bar.

## Readings

* First, read chapters 5--7 from *Learning Android*.

## Demonstration

Based on [GUI widgets](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/gui-widgets.pdf), [Layout](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/layout.pdf), [Action bar](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/action-bar.pdf). [Code](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/02/lecture-code-02.zip).

## Helpful Videos

Note: these videos are not even a year old, but already slightly out of date. If you can't find some part of Android Studio or something isn't working, please confer with your classmates or send an e-mail!
