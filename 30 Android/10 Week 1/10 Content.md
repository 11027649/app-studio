## Assessment

This first homework assignment will be graded *in class* next week. You will need to show the app working on a real device. See the [Android documentation](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html) on how to do this.

Your work on this assignment will be evaluated along two axes primarily:

* *Scope* -- to what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

* *Correctness* -- to what extent is your code free of bugs?
