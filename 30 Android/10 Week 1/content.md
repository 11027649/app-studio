# Week 1: Getting Started

If you missed the installation instructions, there are still [there](/installation/android)!

You'll be introduced to writing classes in Java, and of course, you are going to install Android Studio and create your first app! That app will not contain a lot of code, but it's still going to take you some time to get used to the Android Studio IDE!


## What to do

1. Each unit contains exercises to help you master the Java language. This week, you'll find a recap of basic object-oriented concepts like classes and instantiation. If you're already familiar, you should still use the lab to get acquainted to Java-specific syntax.

    - Go to [Lab 1](https://lab.cs50.io/Vluuks/AndroidPractice/labified/Week1/Lab/).
    - Login with your GitHub credentials, which will be used to save your lab between sessions.


2. Before making an app, you'll need some explanation about the parts of Android that you need to make it. In this unit, we focus on the basics of building a **user interface**, or in other words: the screens that the user sees and can touch and interact with.

    - Read about [Views](/android-reference/views)
    - Practice with  [ConstraintLayout](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/constraint-layout/index.html)

3. Now you are ready to make your first app, [Mr. Potatohead](/guided/mr-potatohead)! The assignment takes you step-by-step through making it, while introducing elements of the Android Studio IDE and the architecture of Android source code. You will likely run in to practical problems, which you will need to solve before the deadline!


## Reference

You'll need to read these to implement parts of your project:

- [Video: supplemental Java introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxRRO9175A)
- [Layouts](/android-reference/layouts)
- [State](/android-reference/state)


## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating **good quality** apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. For this week, make sure you try, as much as possible, to create an app that excels in these respects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends


## Grading

*Before* the deadline, complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit the link to your project's GitHub repository at [Unit 1](/submit/unit-1).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show your finished exercises **and** the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
