# Unit 3: Lists and adapters

In this unit, you'll learn about interfaces in Java and about making lists of information in Android. You'll also learn about getting information from the internet to make cool apps. The project is an app that allows you to order some stuff off the menu in a restaurant!


## Exercises

Each unit contains exercises to help you master the Java language. If you already know Java, some of the exercises will not take much time. But defininitely do them anyway!

- [Interfaces](/java-exercises/interfaces)


## Android explanation

Before making an app, you'll find some explanation about the parts of Android. In this unit, we focus on the basics of lists and adapters. Adapters are a specific construct to make displaying large lists very efficient on an otherwise limited-memory device.

- [List views](/android-reference/lists)
- [Multiple activities](/android-reference/multiple-activities)
- [Listeners](/android-reference/listeners)
- [Persistence](/android-reference/persistence)


## Project

You can choose between two projects:

- **Guided project: [Friendsr](/guided/friendsr)** takes you step-by-step through making an app. You'll probably choose this one if you haven't built applications on a platform before.

- **Unguided project: [Mad Libs](/projects/mad-libs)** gives you a set of requirements with which you make your app. You'll probably choose this one if you have done more than a couple of programming courses. If you don't know how to start, talk to your teacher or switch to the guided project!


## Getting credit

Make sure that you complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github *before* the deadline. In the next class session, show your exercises and the working app to one of the staff.

Completing the exercises can earn you 1 point per week. The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  

This week, we will look at the following quality aspects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
- level of separation between "friend" storage and user interface code
