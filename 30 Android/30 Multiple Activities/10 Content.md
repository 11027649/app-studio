# Multiple Activities

This week we will talk about the lifecycle of an activity in Android as it is created, paused, destroyed, etc. We will learn how to create an app with more than one activity and launch one activity from another using Intents. We will also talk about activity state and Bundles.

- You might already have worked with Intents, but if you haven't (or to refresh your memory) [this](http://www.journaldev.com/9044/android-intent-handling-between-activities-example-tutorial) tutorial explains shortly how it works.
