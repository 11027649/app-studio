# Multiple Activities

This week we will talk about the lifecycle of an activity in Android as it is created, paused, destroyed, etc. We will learn how to create an app with more than one activity and launch one activity from another using Intents. We also learned about how to play music and audio clips using the `MediaPlayer` class.

And we will talk about activity state and Bundles, as well as application-level preferences. We will also learn how to make an app that interacts with data files, and learn how to capture photos using the Android device's camera.

## Demonstration

Based on [MediaPlayer](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/mediaplayer.pdf), [Activity Lifecycle](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/activity-lifecycle.pdf), [Intents](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/intents.pdf). [Code](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/03/lecture-code-03.zip).

And on [State](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/state-preferences.pdf), [Files/storage](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/files-storage.pdf), [Camera](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lectures/camera.pdf).
