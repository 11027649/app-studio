# Multiple Activities

This week we will talk about the lifecycle of an activity in Android as it is created, paused, destroyed, etc. We will learn how to create an app with more than one activity and launch one activity from another using Intents. We will also talk about activity state and Bundles.

## Tutorials to get you started

You might already have worked with Intents, but if you haven't (or to refresh your memory) [this](http://www.journaldev.com/9044/android-intent-handling-between-activities-example-tutorial) tutorial explains shortly how it works.

As was shown in the demonstration, you'll be working with SharedPreferences from this week onward. Follow [this](http://www.journaldev.com/9412/android-shared-preferences-example-tutorial) tutorial to get an even better understanding of how it works.

Additionally, a short [explanation](http://www.quicktips.in/handling-activity-state-using-saved-instance-state-bundle/) on SavedInstanceState.

## Helpful Videos

Note: these videos are not even a year old, but already slightly out of date. If you can't find some part of Android Studio or something isn't working, please confer with your classmates or send an e-mail!

## Code Style

As mentioned after the demonstration, Google has specific guidelines on Android code style. The documentation can be found [here](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html). Note the message at the top: "Contributions to Android that do not adhere to these rules are generally not accepted". Be sure to read it through!
