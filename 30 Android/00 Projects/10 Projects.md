# Android Course

By completing the units on this page, you'll learn about the Android platform for making apps. Usually, Android apps are written using the Java programming language. Each unit contains some Java exercises to help you understand the syntax and teach you about object-oriented programming. We assume that you have previous programming experience in C or Python.

## Unit 1

In this unit, you'll be introduced to writing *classes* in Java, and of course, you are going to install Android Studio and create your first app! That app will not contain a lot of code, but it's still going to take you some time to get used to the Android Studio IDE!

- Follow the instructions on these pages from the Android website:
    - [Create an Android project](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html)
    - [Run your app](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html)
    - [Build a simple user interface](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.html)
- Practice with Java:
    - [Methods, properties and constructors](/android-exercises/classes)
    - [Parameters and return values](/android-exercises/parameters-and-return-values)
- Learn about Android:
    - [Widgets](/android/widgets) (TODO)
    - [Layouts](/android/layouts)
    - [State](/android/state)
- Make [Mr. Potatohead](/projects/mr-potatohead).

## Unit 2

In this unit, you'll learn about methods in Java and about creating apps that have multiple screens. In fact, we have a cute app for you to make, that has fun stories and many screens!

- Practice with Java:
    - [References](/android-exercises/references)
    - [Public and private](/android-exercises/public-vs-private)
- Learn about Android:
    - [Multiple activities](/android/multiple-activities)
    - [Storage](/android/storage)
- Make [Mad Libs](/projects/mad-libs).

## Unit 3

In this unit, you'll learn about objects in Java and about making lists of information in Android. The project is an app that allows you to order some stuff off the menu in a restaurant!

- Practice with Java:
    - [Static versus non-static](/android-exercises/static-vs-non-static)
    - [Interfaces](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q14.pdf)
- Learn about Android:
    - [Listeners](/android/listeners)
    - [List views](/android/lists)
    - [Volley](/android/volley) library
    - [Persistence](/android/persistence)
- Make the [Restaurant](/projects/restaurant) app.

## Unit 4

In this unit, you'll learn about public and private information in classes, and you are going to use databases in your app for the first time! The app that you're making is a useful to-do list app.

- Practice with Java:
    - [Exceptions](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q10.pdf)
    - [Inheritance](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q11.pdf)
- Learn about Android:
    - [SQLite](/android/sqlite)
    - [Activity life cycle](/android/state)
- Make [To-do List](/projects/to-do-list).

## Unit 5

In this unit, you'll learn about static variables and about model classes. The app that you're making is a continuation of the previous unit. The to-do list app will now support multiple to-do lists!

- Practice with Java:
    - [Type information](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q12.pdf)
    - [Polymorphism](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q13.pdf)
- Learn about Android:
    - [Models](/android/models) classes
    - [SQLite](/android/sqlite), if needed
- Make [Many Lists](/projects/many-lists).

## Unit 6

In this unit, you'll learn about using Firebase, which is an online database from Google. It allows you to make apps that help people communicate, share information or simply chat! The final project is of your own choosing.

- Make [Your own app](/projects/your-own).
- Learn about [Essential design principles](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/design/802/).
- Learn about [Firebase](/android/firebase) for making "online" apps.
- Use [Better Code Hub](/guides/better-code-hub) for your code.
