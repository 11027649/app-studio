# Android Course

By completing the units on this page, you'll learn about the Android platform for making apps. Usually, Android apps are written using the Java programming language. Each unit contains some Java exercises to help you understand the syntax and teach you about object-oriented programming. We assume that you have previous programming experience in C or Python.

## Unit 1: Getting Started

In this unit, you'll be introduced to writing classes in Java, and of course, you are going to install Android Studio and create your first app! That app will not contain a lot of code, but it's still going to take you some time to get used to the Android Studio IDE!

1. To get started, follow the instructions on these pages from the Android website:

    - [Create an Android project](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html)
    - [Run your app](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html)
    - [Build a simple user interface](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.html)

    Note: in the tutorial above, you got a sneak peek at the new programming language called Kotlin! However, this course uses Java for developing apps. From now on, when creating your projects, leave the "Kotlin" and "C++" options unchecked.

2. Every unit contains exercises for the Java language. If you already know Java, some of the exercises will not take much time. But defininitely do them anyway!

    - [Methods, properties and constructors](/android-exercises/classes)
    - [Inheritance](/android-exercises/inheritance)

3. Before making an app, you'll find some explanation about the parts of Android that you need to make apps. In this unit, we focus on the basics of building a **user interface**, or in other words: the screens that the user sees and can touch and interact with.

    - [Views](/android/views)
    - [Layouts](/android/layouts)
    - [State](/android/state)

4. Now you are ready to make your first app, [Mr. Potatohead](/projects/mr-potatohead).

## Unit 2: Activities and Navigation

In this unit, you'll learn about references in Java and about creating apps that have multiple screens. You'll also learn about including resources like text and images in your app. In fact, we have a cute app for you to make, that has fun stories and a couple of screens!

- Practice with Java:
    - [References](/android-exercises/references)
    - [Public and private](/android-exercises/public-vs-private)
- Learn about Android:
    - [Multiple activities](/android/multiple-activities)
    - [Storage](/android/storage)
    - [Model classes](/android/models)
    - [Back navigation](/android/backnav) (TODO)
    - [Designing effective navigation](https://developer.android.com/training/design-navigation/index.html)
- Make [Mad Libs](/projects/mad-libs).

## Unit 3: Lists

In this unit, you'll learn about interfaces in Java and about making lists of information in Android. You'll also learn about getting information from the internet to make cool apps. The project is an app that allows you to order some stuff off the menu in a restaurant!

- Practice with Java:
    - [Static versus non-static](/android-exercises/static-vs-non-static)
    - [Interfaces](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q14.pdf)
- Learn about Android:
    - [Listeners](/android/listeners)
    - [List views](/android/lists)
    - [Volley](/android/volley) library
    - [Persistence](/android/persistence)
    - [Snackbar](https://material.io/guidelines/components/snackbars-toasts.html)
- Make the [Restaurant](/projects/restaurant) app.

## Unit 4: Databases

In this unit, you'll learn about exceptions and inheritance in Java, and you are going to use databases in your app for the first time! The app that you're making is a very serious but very useful to-do list app.

- Practice with Java:
    - [Exceptions](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q10.pdf)
    - [Inheritance](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q11.pdf)
- Learn about Android:
    - [SQLite](/android/sqlite)
    - [Activity life cycle](/android/state)
    - [Empty state](https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/empty-states.html)
- Learn about writing good code:
    - [Better Code Hub](/guides/better-code-hub)
- Make [To-do List](/projects/to-do-list).

## Unit 5: Fragments

In this unit, you'll learn about polymorphism in Java. You're also going to learn about using Fragments for building the user interface. The app that you're making is a continuation of the previous unit. The to-do list app will now support multiple to-do lists!

- Practice with Java:
    - [Type information](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q12.pdf)
    - [Polymorphism](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/egs/q13.pdf)
- Learn about Android:
    - [Model classes](/android/models)
    - [SQLite](/android/sqlite), if needed
    - [Fragments](/android/fragments) (TODO)
- Learn about writing good code:
    - [Better Code Hub](/guides/better-code-hub)
- Make [Many Lists](/projects/many-lists).

## Unit 6: Prototyping Apps

In this unit, you'll learn about using Firebase, which is an online database from Google. It allows you to make apps that help people communicate, share information or simply chat. The final project is of your own choosing, and there are many other libraries that you can use to make a fun app!

- Learn about design:
    - [Essential design principles](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/design/802/)
- Learn about Android:
    - [Firebase](/android/firebase) for making "online" apps
- Choose one of these to implement in your final app: (TODO)
    - [Sound effects]()
    - [Camera]()
    - [Text-to-speech]()
    - [Graphics]()
    - [Maps]()
    - [Gestures]()
    - [Notifications]()
    - [Services]()
- Finally, make [Your own app](/projects/your-own).
