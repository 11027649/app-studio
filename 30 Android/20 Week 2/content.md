# Unit 2: Activities and Navigation

In this unit, you'll learn about classes in Java and how to model your app into different classes.


## Java labs

Each unit contains exercises to help you master the Java language. This week, you'll learn about `private` and `public` modifiers, `static`, constants and `enum`s. If you're already familiar, you should still use the lab to get acquainted to Java-specific syntax.

- Go to [Lab 2](https://lab.cs50.io/Vluuks/AndroidPractice/labified/Week2/Lab/).
- Login with your GitHub credentials, which will be used to save your lab between sessions.


## Android explanation

- Read how [Access modifiers] are used in Android projects.


## What to do

Implement [Tic Tac Toe](/guided/tic-tac-toe).

<!-- - **Unguided project: [Hangman](/projects/hangman)** gives you a set of requirements with which you make your app. You'll probably choose this one if you have done more than a couple of programming courses. If you don't know how to start, talk to your teacher or switch to the guided project! -->


## Reference

- [UML](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/content/RationalEdge/sep04/bell/index.html)
- [Model classes](/android-reference/models)


## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating **good quality** apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. For this week, make sure you try, as much as possible, to create an app that excels in these respects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
- level of separation between game code and user interface code


## Grading

*Before* the deadline, complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit the link to your project's GitHub repository at [Unit 2](/submit/unit-2).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show your finished exercises **and** the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
