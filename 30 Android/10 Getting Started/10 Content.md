# Getting Started

This week we will cover background information about the Android platform, and learn enough basics to create our first simple app.

## Readings

First, read chapters 1--3 from *Learning Android*, which will get you in the mood!

## About the material

You've downloaded Android Studio, but now what? Luckily, the internet offers a lot of walkthroughs and tutorials and we have selected a few to guide you through the upcoming weeks. Note that while these tutorials are intended as guidelines, we recommend that you read them all through.

## Tutorials to get you started

### Setting up Android Studio

We now move to setting up Android Studio. Because developing Android Apps makes use of various *Developing Tools*, you need to install them first. Thus, in order to do that, follow this [Beginning Android Development](https://www.raywenderlich.com/120177/beginning-android-development-tutorial-installing-android-studio) tutorial on setting up Android Studio.

Once Android Studio is set up, it walks you through the steps towards creating your first *Hello World* app!

### Java syntax

With Android app development comes a programming language: Java. Luckily for us, Java has a lot in common with Python and therefore the basics will hold no secrets for you there. However, some syntax is slightly different compared to other languages you know, so take a quick look at [Java Basics for Android Development](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/java-basics-for-android-development-part-2) to make sure you get the syntax right.

Google has specific guidelines on Android code style. The documentation can be found [here](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html). Note the message at the top: "Contributions to Android that do not adhere to these rules are generally not accepted". Be sure to read it through!
