# Getting Started

This week we will cover background information about the Android platform, and learn enough basics to create our first simple app. With Android app development comes a programming language: Java. Luckily for us, Java has a lot in common with Python and therefore the basics will hold no secrets for you there. However, some syntax is slightly different compared to other languages you know.

## Setting up Android Studio

We now move to setting up Android Studio. Because developing Android Apps makes use of various *Developing Tools*, you need to install them first. Thus, in order to do that, follow this [Beginning Android Development](https://www.raywenderlich.com/120177/beginning-android-development-tutorial-installing-android-studio) tutorial on setting up Android Studio.

Once Android Studio is set up, it walks you through the steps towards creating your first *Hello World* app!


## Creating your first project

We'll now show you how to create your first Android Studio project. What are things to pay attention to when setting up a project? What kind of components are projects made up of?

## Sharing your project on GitHub

In order to be able to check your code, your project's source code should be available to us on GitHub.  Not only does this allow us to check your submission, it also grants you the possibility to keep a track record of changes to your code, provided that you commit (and push) to GitHub regularly. This way, you can document changes to your application which allow you to better understand bugs in your code and also revert back to a previous version, should you need it. You can do this in various ways. 

You can share an Android Studio project on GitHub using Android Studio's integrated version control.

You can also do the reverse and open an existing project on GitHub using Android Studio. This could come in handy if you are working from different computers and want to progress your app on your desktop instead of your laptop, for example.

If the above does not work or you prefer to work in the terminal, you can also use the command line to set up a link with GitHub.

If you struggle getting your project on GitHub, do not hesitate to ask for help! It's very important to get this working quickly, because it's needed to hand in your assignments, so make sure to ask if you're not able to figure it out yourself.
