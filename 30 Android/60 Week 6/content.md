# Week 6: Data from the Web

The web is full of data. Some of it, like on newspaper websites, is easy to read for humans but less so for computers. Other data is especially formatted to be easy to read *by computers*. One especially popular format for such data is [JSON](https://www.json.org), which we'll use in this unit.


## Reference

You'll need to read these before implementing your project.

- [Volley](/android-reference/volley)
- [Parsing JSON](/android-reference/parsing-json)


## What to do

1. Practice with exceptions ðŸ˜±:

    - Go to [Lab 5](https://lab.cs50.io/Vluuks/AndroidPractice/labified/Week5/Lab/).
    - Login with your GitHub credentials, which will be used to save your lab between sessions.

2. Implement [Restaurant](/guided/restaurant).


## Goals

Our main goal for this course is getting you some in-depth experience on important aspects of creating **good quality** apps. You'll practice with various techniques every week. For this week, make sure you try, as much as possible, to create an app that excels in these respects:

- layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- easy to use, no odds and ends
- more advanced code quality such as the structure of your project, separation of concerns


## Grading

*Before* the deadline, complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github. Ask for help if needed!

1. Submit the link to your project's GitHub repository at [Unit 6](/submit/unit-6).

2. On (or before) the date of the deadline, show your finished exercises **and** the working app to one of the staff.

3. Next, acquire feedback on your app and improve on it. Improvements should be finished and synced with GitHub before the course's final deadline.
