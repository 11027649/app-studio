# State Restoration and Multiple Lists

This week we will cover your app's state restoration more thoroughly and focus on the Activity Lifecycle, as well as implementing the possibility of multiple lists. We will also briefly touch on Android's Fragments.

## Tutorials to get you started

Handling the Activity Lifecycle is a very important part in the development process. Therefore it is vital you have a solid understanding of how it works. [This](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/application_fundamentals/activity_lifecycle/) is a thorough explanation of the Activity Lifecycle and contains a very handy walkthrough to apply the theoretical stuff.

As mentioned in the demonstration, fragments are widely used in Android applications. To get a good understand of how they work and how to use them in your own application, follow [this](http://www.journaldev.com/9266/android-fragment-example-tutorial-lifecycle) tutorial. An Android example of a *Preferences Fragment* can be found [here](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/preference/PreferenceFragment.html).
