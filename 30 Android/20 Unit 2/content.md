# Unit 2: Activities and Navigation

In this unit, you'll learn about classes in Java and how to model your app into different classes.


## Exercises

Each unit contains exercises to help you master the Java language. If you already know Java, some of the exercises will not take much time. But defininitely do them anyway!

- [Public and private](/java-exercises/public-vs-private)
- [Static versus non-static](/java-exercises/static-vs-non-static)
- [Inheritance](/java-exercises/inheritance)

Also, [read about](https://www.leepoint.net/oop/enums/enums.html) `enum`s in Java. Understand when and how to use these.


## Android explanation

Before making an app, you'll find some explanation about the parts of Android. In this unit, we focus on the basics of building **model classes**. You can use model classes to represent the core of what you're app is really about.

- [Layouts](/android-reference/layouts)
- [UML](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/content/RationalEdge/sep04/bell/index.html)
- [Model classes](/android-reference/models)


## Project

You can choose between two projects:

- **Guided project: [Tic Tac Toe](/guided/tic-tac-toe)** takes you step-by-step through making an app. You'll probably choose this one if you haven't built applications on a platform before.

- **Unguided project: [Hangman](/projects/hangman)** gives you a set of requirements with which you make your app. You'll probably choose this one if you have done more than a couple of programming courses. If you don't know how to start, talk to your teacher or switch to the guided project!


## Getting credit

Make sure that you complete the exercises and put your finished project on Github *before* the deadline. In the next class session, show your exercises and the working app to one of the staff.

Completing the exercises can earn you 1 point per week. The project will be checked for full completion of the assignment and consideration of all requirements. You can earn points according to the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial error.                     |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  

This week, we will look at the following quality aspects:

- (from last week) layout, margins, compatibility with multiple phone sizes
- (from last week) basic code quality such as comments, names, consistency and design
- (from last week) easy to use, no odds and ends
- level of separation between game code and user interface code
