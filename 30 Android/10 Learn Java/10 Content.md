# Learn Java

This week we will cover background information about the Android platform, and learn enough basics to create our first simple app.

## Readings

First, read chapters 1--3 from *Learning Android*, which will get you in the mood!

## Tutorials to get you started

When first opening Android Studio, it has already generated a lot of files for you. To get a better understanding of how your Android project is organised, read [this](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_hello_world_example.htm) (short) explanation on the anatomy of the Android application. If you haven’t created a Hello World! application yet, you can follow the guidelines in here. Otherwise, just make sure you understand the differences in the files noted. 

For this week’s app you are asked to implement a few different widgets. Don’t know where to start? [This](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.html) official Android tutorial takes you through all the small steps to create a basic *user interface (UI)*.
