# Introducing Java

This first week, you'll need to start learning the programming languages that you will be working in for your Android projects. You'll need to start understanding object-oriented programming, because the Android platform requires you to take an object-oriented approach when making apps!

## Readings

First, read chapters 1--3 from *Learning Android*, which will get you in the mood!

## Exercises for Wednesday

From the Java for C programmers [tutorial](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/tsj4cp.html), please complete exercises 1--6.

## Exercises for Friday

From the Java for C programmers [tutorial](http://www.davin.50webs.com/research/1999/tsj4cp.html), please complete exercises 7--11.

## Videos

Note: the videos below are only about a year old, but already slightly out of date. If you can't find some part of Android Studio or something isn't working, please confer with your classmates or send an e-mail!

## Assessment

This first homework assignment will be graded *in class* next week. You will need to show the app working on a real device. See the [Android documentation](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html) on how to do this.

Your work on this assignment will be evaluated along two axes primarily:

* *Scope* -- to what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

* *Correctness* -- to what extent is your code free of bugs?
